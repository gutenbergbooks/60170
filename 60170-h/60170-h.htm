    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> attention of archæologists and students of the ancient Mexican
    hieroglyphs has latterly been directed to the mysterious subject of the
    origin of the astronomical and architectural knowledge that existed
    in Mexico, Guatemala, and Yucatan before the discovery of America.
    In the United States researches have also been made for the purpose
    of establishing, upon a scientific basis, conclusions respecting the
    tribes who made the extraordinary ramparts and geometrically planned
    inclosures in Ohio.</p>

  <p>It is a remarkable fact that although, since the period when Mexico was
    conquered by Cortes, an almost uninterrupted series of investigations
    have taken place into the peculiar conditions of civilization of the
    Mexican and Central American Indians, nothing satisfactory has yet been
    ascertained which explains the manner in which that civilization could
    have arisen amongst those exceptionally instructed races.</p>

  <p>Las Casas who, in the sixteenth century, lived for many years amongst
    the Indians in his diocese of Chiapas and Yucatan and saw several of
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span> temples in that region,
    declared that the land contained a secret.
    That secret may possibly be discovered if the hieroglyphs and symbolic
    characters of the Toltecs and Aztecs can be interpreted. But until
    trustworthy methods of decipherment are determined, all conclusions, in
    default of other evidence, must necessarily be conjectural.</p>

  <p>It was with the vague expectation that I should observe, either amongst
    the earthworks in the North or in the constructions at Palenque and
    Uxmal, analogies with the works of other races in Asia or Polynesia,
    that the travels described in this volume were undertaken. After my
    arrival in England a brief paper upon the subject of those travels,
    so far as they related to Guatemala and Mexico, was read before the
    British Association in Edinburgh and was afterwards published in 1872
    under the title of “The Ruined Cities of Central America.”</p>

  <p>More than twenty years then elapsed before the approaching termination
    of my naval career gave me sufficient leisure to examine my journals
    with that exclusive attention which the complicated and perplexing
    nature of the subject required. This interval of time has enabled
    me to obtain a more vivid perception of the relative proportions
    of the problem, and to bring together in a more defined focus the
    impressions and observations which had been written during the journey.
    The theories then adopted have been modified or strengthened by the
    knowledge <span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>that has been subsequently acquired in other quarters of the
    world.</p>

  <p>It will be observed, upon an examination of the illustrations of the
    ruins of Uxmal, that the Indians in Yucatan must have possessed great
    architectural capacities. Pyramids, Temples, Monasteries and other
    religious structures were built under most difficult circumstances, in
    a manner which commands admiration.</p>

  <p>But it is not only the later civilization of the Mexican Indians that
    has to be taken into consideration in any attempts that may be made
    to solve the difficult and complex problem of this Indian advance
    towards higher conditions of life. Underlying the whole question
    are the native proclivities based upon the strange and significant
    practices of earlier forms of Pagan superstitions and sacrifices. Some
    of the profoundly interesting characteristics of these developments of
    the aboriginal Indian belief in supernatural influences have formed
    the subject of that chapter which relates to the ancient religious
    observances of the North American Indians.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />
  <p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.—The illustration of the Serpent Emblem in the
    Casa de las Monjas is reproduced from a large photograph taken
    at Uxmal by William D. James, Esq. It will be observed that the
    details of the sculpture of the rattlesnake are very clearly
    defined.</p>

  <p>The illustrations marked † are from a series of valuable
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
    photographs, also taken at Uxmal, by Captain Herbert Dowding,
    Royal Navy, who placed at my disposal such of them as I
    considered to be required for the purposes of this work.</p>

  <p>I wish to call particular attention to the representation of
    that part of the Casa de las Monjas where the adjacent Temple
    of the Dwarf is seen. In comparing the structures with the
    pyramid, it has to be remembered that the Casa de las Monjas is
    placed upon a raised platform not less than seventeen feet in
    height. The Pyramid of the Dwarf is completely detached.</p>

  <p>Upon an examination of the frontispiece it will be noticed that
    the centre stone which, when I saw it lying on the ground at
    Palenque, was uninjured, is there shown in two portions which
    are kept in position by iron clamps.</p>

  <p>It was accidentally broken when being removed from Palenque to
    the museum in the City of Mexico.</p>

  <p>The left slab, upon which is graven the smaller figure, is from
    a photograph of a moulding made by M. Desiré Charnay. The right
    slab is from a photograph of the original stone now placed in
    the museum at Washington, and which was represented in the
    Memoir upon the Palenque Tablet written by Professor Rau, and
    published by the Smithsonian Institution. The photographs of
    the right and left slabs have been reduced to the size of that
    of the centre, and thus an exact reproduction of the whole of
    the Tablet of the Cross has been obtained. The representation
    in the frontispiece is, approximately, upon the scale of one
    inch to the foot and is therefore a twelfth of the size of the
    original tablet when it was in its position within the temple.</p>

  <p>The illustrations of Indians are from photographs collected by
    me during my travels and were selected as being typical of the
    respective tribes. My small sketch of the entrance to the Casa
    de las Monjas at Uxmal is drawn to scale, and the character of
    the Indian horizontal arch is delineated in its architectural
    proportions.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Upon</span> my return to
    England, after having completed several years of
    foreign service, I obtained permission from the Admiralty to proceed
    upon a journey into North and Central America.</p>

  <p>There were certain subjects that I particularly wished to examine,
    especially those that were connected with the mounds or earthworks in
    the valley of the Ohio, and the ruined temples of the southern regions
    of Mexico and Guatemala. In the lands inhabited, at the time of the
    Spanish Conquest, by Indian tribes who had reached a singular form
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> civilisation, the origin of which has not yet been traced, it is
    probable that some discovery will be made which will throw light upon
    the manner in which their knowledge was obtained.</p>

  <p>The problems which have yet to be solved with respect to the ruins
    at Palenque, and in Yucatan, have a fascination for those who are
    interested in the endeavour to seek an explanation of the strange
    events that must have happened amongst the Indians who inhabited that
    part of the world. It is possible that evidences may be found which
    will lead to the conclusion that at some period, not very remote, there
    has been an introduction amongst the aboriginal races of influences
    derived from Europe or Asia, and it is not unreasonable to expect that
    when the hieroglyphs within the altars of Palenque are interpreted,
    much that is now unintelligible will be made clear. The investigations
    of Mr. Stephens, in 1840, together with the earlier reports of Del
    Rio and Dupaix, directed attention to the extraordinary character of
    the pyramids and stone structures that were found deserted and ruined
    within the tropical lands and forests.</p>

  <p>In the North the field of research has been carefully examined by
    competent explorers, but, even in that region, there is much that is
    open to theory or conjecture with regard to the purposes for which the
    great earthworks in the interior of the Continent were raised. There is
    also an almost complete absence of definite knowledge respecting the
    race and subsequent migrations of the tribes that dwelt within those
    embankments. The extensive shell heaps or kitchen middens found near
    the seacoasts, have been partly excavated, and, judging from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
    implements of bone and the weapons which they contain, it has been made
    evident that the Indians must have had customs singularly corresponding
    with those of the tribes who formed the shell mounds in Europe.</p>

  <p>I had no theories to establish, but I expected to find that the tribes
    in the West and North-West resembled the Manchu race I had seen in the
    North of China, and that the Indians in Central America would show
    traces of kindred with the Malays. I also thought that, in the ruined
    temples, there would be seen architectural affinities with the Buddhist
    monasteries in Upper Burmah and Cambodia. These were however only
    surmises, and I was prepared to recognise that it would be necessary to
    adopt other conclusions.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to arrange for any decided plan of travel, but I
    intended, in the first instance, to visit the Navy Yards and observe
    what progress was being made with respect to ships and their armaments;
    and then to proceed to those parts of America where the principal works
    of the aboriginal tribes still remain. Finally, I hoped to be able to
    cross the Continent and go down the Mexican and Guatemalan coasts, and
    from one of the ports on the Western seaboard, cross Central America
    from the Pacific to the Atlantic towards Yucatan. Such was the outline
    of the direction that I proposed to follow, but which would be varied
    or changed as circumstances might require.</p>

  <p>We left Liverpool in the Samaria on the 15th of March, 1869, and
    reached New York late in the evening of the 28th, after having
    experienced a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> continuation of head winds and stormy weather, which
    made our passage across the Atlantic long and tedious. My first care,
    upon arrival, was to call upon Mr. Henry Grinnell,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> whose exertions
    and services in prosecuting, at his own expense, the search for Sir
    John Franklin and the ships beset in the Arctic ice, are so well known.</p>

  <p>In the year 1850 Lady Franklin sent her appeal to the President of the
    United States, in which she urged the Americans, as a kindred people,
    to help in the enterprise of rescuing our sailors from perishing from
    cold and starvation in those Northern latitudes. The appeal was not
    unanswered, but in consequence of the unavoidable delays incidental to
    obtaining the sanction of Congress for the necessary expenditure, there
    was much risk of the season becoming too advanced for reaching the
    channels in time, and that, consequently, a whole year’s work would be
    lost. It was then that Mr. Grinnell, a leading merchant and shipowner,
    prepared and fitted out for Arctic service two of his own vessels.
    These ships, respectively called the “Advance” and the “Rescue,” were
    officered and manned by the Naval Department and reached the ice in
    time to do useful work. The fate, however, of Sir John Franklin and his
    crew was not ascertained, although traces of his winter quarters were
    discovered.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

  <p>At Washington, I found that Congress was sitting. Political affairs
    were in an unusually excited condition in consequence of the state of
    things resulting from the Civil War and the admission of negroes to
    the franchise. Soon after my arrival I attended the Levée of President
    Grant, and in the evening dined with our Minister, Mr. Thornton, at the
    Legation. Several members of the Diplomatic body were present, some of
    whom I had previously met in Europe.</p>

  <p>The question of the capacity of the negroes with respect to their
    taking an equal share with the white citizens in the management of the
    government policy occupied the attention of politicians. It was thought
    impossible to foresee what would be the effect of the emancipation of
    over three millions of slaves. It seemed certain that the Americans
    would have eventually a complicated problem to deal with, presenting
    grave difficulties.</p>

  <p>From Washington I went into the Southern States. In the districts
    where large numbers of slaves had been employed, the subject of their
    education was being seriously considered, and schools were established
    for the purpose of advancing the intelligence of the black children.
    The ignorant and hopeful parents were speculating upon the brilliant
    future that seemed to be opening before them. They had vague dreams
    that some new and prosperous destiny was going to be granted to their
    race. They thought that, as a result of freedom and education, their
    children would become active and useful citizens, equal, if they had
    fair opportunities, to those who had been their masters.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

  <p>Such was the universal belief amongst the elders, and great will be the
    disappointment amongst the children upon growing up into manhood to
    discover, that, in obedience to an unexplained law, there seems to be a
    limit to their power of reaching the standard of proficiency to which
    they aspired.</p>

  <p>I had seen the emancipated negroes in the islands of the West Indies,
    and the extraordinary condition of Hayti when under the rule of the
    black emperor Soulouque. It was therefore not possible to think that
    there was any probability of these school children rising to an
    equality with the white races around them. There was something almost
    painful in listening to the faith of the fathers in the prospects of
    their sons, and the earnest manner in which they spoke of their future
    career, if they worked hard and did their best to deserve success.</p>

  <p>After passing through the low-lying lands near the coast, which had
    in previous years been cultivated by this race, I proceeded up the
    Chesapeake Bay, and stopped at Annapolis for the purpose of looking
    at the Naval Academy. The system of training officers for sea service
    is, in many respects, radically different from that which is followed
    in England. With regard to the comparative results it is difficult to
    form an opinion. It is presumable that the English system is the best
    for developing the naval capacity of English lads, and the regulations
    carried out at Annapolis may be more suitable for the Americans. Both
    schools succeed in producing efficient young officers.</p>

  <p>The principle underlying the policy of the training system in England
    is youth. It is thought that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> order to make a good sailor, officer
    or man, the future seaman must be entered when young, and thus begin
    his sea life while he is still capable of being naturally accustomed to
    the performance of his duties. In America and also with the maritime
    powers on the European continent different conclusions are held. At
    Annapolis the age for entry is between fourteen and sixteen, and as the
    entries usually take place at the latest period, the age upon passing
    out into sea service is about twenty. The preliminary training is
    thoroughly carried out, and the Academy is exceptionally fortunate in
    being situated on the shores of a large and well-sheltered bay where
    there is room for practising the necessary gunnery exercises.</p>

  <p>The Military Academy at West Point is placed in a very beautiful
    situation. Nothing can be finer than the scenery at that part of
    the Hudson river. The site has been well selected with regard to
    the various requirements for training officers for general service,
    with reference to drills, cavalry exercises, and topographical and
    engineering studies. Professor Bartlett, to whom I had a letter of
    introduction from Professor Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, did
    everything that was in his power to make my stay agreeable. I was also
    much indebted to General Pitcher, the officer in command, who made me
    acquainted with all the details of the system in operation.</p>

  <p>The Cadets are chosen in the same manner as at Annapolis. Ten are
    appointed annually by the President, and the remainder are usually
    nominated by members of Congress from their respective states. Private
    allowances are discouraged, and the Government <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>make a grant of 500
    dollars a year for each pupil, or the same allowance that is given to
    the midshipmen at Annapolis. General Pitcher told me that about one
    half of the candidates usually failed at the preliminary examination,
    and that, upon the average, one-third of the remainder were rejected at
    the succeeding examinations, a proportion of failures which corresponds
    with that at the Naval Academy. They rise at five, clean their rooms,
    place everything in order, attend early drills, and are constantly
    at work throughout the day. The series of drills and studies is very
    continuous, and there is only just sufficient time allowed for meals,
    and very little time for recreation. The average age of the lads
    is over twenty-one; the term is for four years. Many distinguished
    officers have graduated here and habits of self-reliance are strictly
    enforced. The principle which governs the system which is maintained
    during the earlier part of the training is that of accustoming each
    cadet to be independent of help.</p>

  <p>In proceeding from West Point, I visited the Shakers at their
    settlements, near the village of Lebanon. I was received by their chief
    Elder, a man named Evans, who, by his energy and firmness of will, had
    obtained much personal influence over the community. The Shakers had
    been successful in securing for themselves a considerable degree of
    financial prosperity which was the result of their economy and industry.</p>

  <p>Evans was acquainted with the scheme of life contemplated by Mr.
    Harris, near Brocton. The community established there had been joined
    by Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> Laurence Oliphant,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and I was interested in hearing the
    opinions of the Shakers about them. Evans thought that they could not
    long keep together, because marriage was permitted amongst its members.
    Marriage, he said, meant personal property and where that existed a
    communistic society could not succeed.</p>

  <p>A few days after arriving at Boston, I dined with Mr. Charles Francis
    Adams, who had for many years been the United States Minister in
    England. I had met him frequently at the house of Sir Charles Lyell in
    London. The conversation turned chiefly upon the conduct of the troops
    in the Civil War,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> all the details of which were eagerly discussed.</p>

  <p>An officer present, who had commanded a brigade with distinction
    throughout the campaign, gave us <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>some information with regard to the
    behaviour of the troops of the Northern army under fire, from the point
    of view of their respective nationalities. Of the negroes he spoke
    highly from personal knowledge, for during a part of his service, a
    regiment of those troops was placed under his command. He said that
    they were not intelligent, but were easily disciplined and controlled.
    They were found to be useful in covering an assault as they did not
    appear to be shaken in their courage or firmness by any great slaughter
    in their ranks.</p>

  <p>The Germans were expected to be cool and phlegmatic, but it was found
    that they were excitable and easily startled and unsettled. The Irish
    were always ready to fight, but they were soon depressed by any
    reverses. The Americans were excellent as cavalry, as infantry they
    were steady and deliberate.</p>

  <p>I mentioned that, at West Point, I had met General <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>Vogdes, who had
    commanded a negro regiment, and that he considered his men to have
    proved that they were reliable and obedient, and capable upon occasions
    of showing that they were not wanting in daring. In the operations
    around Nashville, a great proportion of the losses in the army fell
    upon the coloured troops in consequence, as the general commanding
    reported, of the brilliant manner in which they charged the enemy’s
    earthworks. This kind of dashing courage on the part of negroes, who
    had been bred in slavery, was surprising. I was deeply interested in
    hearing the details of the war, particularly such of them as related to
    the conduct of the black troops when under fire.</p>

  <p>I had seen in the South, the emotional side of the character of the
    American born negroes, as shown in their political meetings and their
    religious services, but I had not been previously aware that these
    apparently lethargic people had by nature, the capacity for becoming
    brave and impulsive soldiers. It is obvious that they felt they were
    fighting for freedom, and for the emancipation of their wives and
    children, the most powerful incentives that could stimulate their
    actions. They were ready and willing to face the risk of death in order
    to obtain that freedom which, to those that have it not, must be the
    most coveted prize that this world can give.</p>

  <p>One afternoon I went to Cambridge for the purpose of meeting Mr.
    Bartlett, a partner in the publishing firm of Messrs. Little and Brown.
    I was indebted to him for many kind acts in assisting me in visiting
    the museums, and we had arranged to go to the Harvard University
    together, in order to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> an interview with Professor Agassiz, who
    had returned from Florida, where he had been engaged in the examination
    of the coral reefs.</p>

  <p>After looking at the extensive collection of corals and shells which
    had been placed in the Museum, we walked across the college grounds
    to the Professor’s house. I delivered my letter of introduction, and
    was received with great courtesy. Agassiz for some time talked about
    his varied experiences in many parts of the world and his recent
    researches, but upon hearing that I was going to visit the prairies in
    the North-west, he showed much interest in the details of the journey
    that I proposed to take.</p>

  <p>He said that he had been in many parts of those prairies, and had made
    several careful investigations with the object of establishing certain
    facts with regard to their formation, and had come to the conclusion
    that they were caused by glacial action. He thought that the theory
    that they were once sea beaches was erroneous, for he was convinced
    that the sea had never been in those regions. He also spoke about the
    consequences of the habits of the numerous herds of buffaloes that had
    roamed, in remote times, over those lands and had made their wallows
    there. These shallow depressions collected large quantities of water,
    and influenced the manner in which many of the streams originated.</p>

  <p>After having drawn my attention to the chief objects of geological
    interest that might possibly come within my notice in the region to the
    south of Lake Superior, Agassiz mentioned his work in Florida. He had
    given much consideration to the outlying banks fringing the southern
    coasts of that promontory.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> The facts he had established were not in
    accordance with the views of Darwin and Lyell. “If,” he said, “the
    Pacific formations were as described by Darwin and others, those on
    the coast of Florida were entirely different. In no way could Darwin’s
    theory explain the Florida formations.” He had ascertained that the
    corals grew up from great depths, for he had dredged to a depth of
    eight hundred fathoms and had brought up live corallines; thus proving
    that they existed and worked in very deep waters. It was his opinion
    that Darwin’s coral theories had not had a sufficient study of evidence
    given to them.</p>

  <p>In the evening, at Mr. Ticknor’s house, there were present at dinner
    Commodore Rogers, Superintendent of the Navy Yard; Mr. Francis
    Parkman, author of several historical works relating to the early
    European settlements in North America; Mr. Hillard, also an author of
    considerable reputation, and Mr. Frank Parker. Mr. Ticknor<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> told us
    anecdotes of his travels in Europe soon after the restoration of Louis
    XVIII. He had known many of the celebrities of that time, and spoke of
    Sir Walter Scott, Sir Humphrey Davy, Mrs. Siddons, Lord and Lady Byron,
    Talleyrand, Madame de Stael and Madame Récamier.</p>

  <p>There was a long discussion upon the uncertain future of the republic.
    It seemed to be considered that as America became more populated, it
    was much <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>to be feared that universal suffrage, freedom and equality
    of race, would lead to disorder. Mr. Ticknor mentioned that Prince
    Metternich, when speaking to him about this subject, remarked that
    there was a great difference between old Austria and America. In
    Austria he had always to look out for mischief and prepare to meet
    it or contrive a remedy. In America, he said, a mischief, if it
    exists, takes time and grows until it gradually forces itself upon the
    attention of the people. Finally, if it becomes alarming, the mass
    deals with it and arrests its progress as it best can, and then things
    go on as before.</p>

  <p>Professor Jeffries Wyman,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who had discovered several extensive
    shell banks on the eastern coasts of Florida, gave me, at his house at
    Cambridge, an interesting account of his investigations. He thought
    that the mounds were entirely formed by the refuse of the food eaten by
    the tribes dwelling near the sea; but, whether by a large settlement
    of tribes in a comparatively short time, or by a small tribe in a
    long time, it was difficult to determine. Some of the banks were from
    fourteen to twenty-five feet high. They varied in length from one
    hundred to five hundred yards. On the tops of several of them he had
    seen large trees, whose age he estimated to be not less than eight
    hundred years. It did not appear that the mounds followed the outlines
    of any particular plan of encampment, except in an instance where one
    of the longest of them had the shape of an amphitheatre.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

  <p>He also examined some fresh water shell heaps. These, he thought, were
    made in the same manner as the sea shell mounds, by the Indians eating
    the fish and piling up the shells. In all of them he had discovered
    fragments of pottery and other marks of human life. The Professor
    proposed that I should make an appointment with him in order to have a
    thorough examination of his collection, not only from the shell heaps,
    but also from the tumuli of the mound builders and other Indian tribes.
    A day for this purpose was accordingly fixed. In the meanwhile my time
    was occupied in visiting the public schools: Mr. Frank Parker, who was
    interested in educational work, usually went with me.</p>

  <p>From a national point of view it was considered of great importance
    that the children of the emigrants should receive a sound education
    so as to enable them to become useful and self-respecting citizens.
    The majority of the parents upon their arrival at New York or Boston,
    do not attempt to seek their fortunes away in the West, but settle in
    those quarters of these cities where they find that others of their
    race are already established. The elder members of the emigrating
    families are quite aware that their age or other circumstances
    practically debar them from all hope of success in any attempts to
    gain a livelihood by their own work. Thus their attention is directed
    to the training of their children, so that these may have a fair start
    in life. For this purpose, the free and thoroughly practical system of
    education carried out in the schools seems to be excellent.</p>

  <p>It is needless to dwell upon the methods adopted in American cities
    for raising the standard of knowledge <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>among the boys and girls of the
    poorer classes, for they are well known. Nothing can be more pleasing
    than to observe the development of the minds of these young wanderers
    from other lands, where their fate was adverse and their lives were
    without hope. They appear to seize with eagerness the chances that are
    given them to attain, by their own intelligence, higher and more secure
    positions, and thus break away from the discouraging conditions into
    which they were born. The construction and size of the school buildings
    were well adapted for their purpose. The health and attention of the
    students are, therefore, not affected by close confinement or the
    insufficiency of pure air.</p>

  <p>There was an institution in Boston, devoted to the work of teaching
    the blind, which had an especial interest of its own, and I was
    therefore glad to accept Dr. Howe’s invitation to dine with him and
    then see Laura Bridgman,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the blind girl, whose education had been so
    successfully managed, and whose history had, for many years, attracted
    observation.</p>

  <p>After dinner Laura came into the room. I noticed that she was of
    average height and looked thin, pale and delicate. She had a shy and
    peculiar manner. Mrs. Howe placed herself in communication with her,
    and Laura immediately became more assured. When I was introduced she
    expressed, by the movements of her fingers, that she was much pleased
    to have my companionship. I asked if she wished to inquire <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>about any
    English friends? She replied, “Yes. Do you know Dickens, how is he?”
    Then suddenly, before I had made any answer, she felt Mrs. Howe’s
    sleeve and said, “You have a new dress,” and named the material—a
    sort of French silk. Mrs. Howe said that the guess was correct. She
    then became more animated and bright, but showed a singularly quick
    impatience when wanting Mrs. Howe to listen to her. When not occupied
    in maintaining a conversation she became quiet and looked sad.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Howe asked in what way she amused herself and what was her
    greatest pleasure. She replied, “reading.” “What reading do you like
    best?” To this question Laura replied, “Bible, hymns and psalms.” Mrs.
    Howe turned round to me and said this answer was very curious as Dr.
    Howe had brought her up without any religious training, because he did
    not wish to give her mind any especial bent in that matter; but owing,
    it was supposed, to the influence and teaching of some friend, she had
    been made acquainted with the Bible and had become intensely attached
    to it.</p>

  <p>It was said that Laura was able to articulate two words—“Doctor” and
    “Grandmother”—and I asked her to say them. “Doctor,” was pronounced in
    a distinct manner giving the sound “Dok-tá.” The word “Grandmother”
    was not so clearly spoken and she gave the sound very rapidly. It
    was however sufficiently expressed to be understood. I was told that
    these words had in some manner been learnt by feeling the throats of
    other people who pronounced them, and finding that certain expansions
    of the muscles occurred when the sounds were made. She conversed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>by
    holding out one hand and moving the fingers. Mrs. Howe held her wrist
    and communicated her remarks by touch upon it. In this manner an
    intelligent conversation was carried on. Laura evidently enjoyed the
    excitement caused by this interchange of ideas, for when thus engaged
    she looked very happy.</p>

  <p>She was blind, deaf and dumb.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the day arranged for my visit to Cambridge, I found Professor
    Wyman prepared to employ several hours in examining the Indian
    collections. He proposed that we should begin by looking carefully over
    the contents of a case within which was placed everything that had been
    discovered in a burial mound in Illinois. The mound had contained the
    bones of nine adults, several fragments of rude stone implements, and
    some arrowheads. The skulls had been flattened and shaped by pressure.</p>

  <p>We then examined the collections of human skulls that had been received
    from all parts of the continent. Amongst these, were several of an
    important character, obtained by Mr. Squier in Central America. They
    were long and flattened upon the top, and were supposed to have
    belonged to the race that built the stone temples in Yucatan. Other
    groups were then compared. It was observable that some tribes had the
    custom of pressing in the back of the head to such an extent as to make
    it nearly perpendicular.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> Others pressed the skulls so as to give them
    great length. In a few instances, they were given a tall, oval form.
    The Californian Indians appear to have given their children a high,
    receding forehead. This method of shaping the head is still followed by
    the Flathead Indians in the West. It is done by the pressure of boards
    tied together in such a manner that the infant gets its skull shaped
    when it is in the cradle.</p>

  <p>A question arose as to the effect of the artificial shapes of the
    head upon the character of the tribes; and particularly, whether, in
    accordance with certain theories, there was any known difference in
    disposition between the tribes who flattened the forehead and those who
    flattened the skull at the back. The Professor said that the matter
    had been the subject of inquiry. It was considered, as far as could
    be ascertained, that the alterations in shape made no difference in
    the character, and that the Indians, whether with long, high, or flat
    heads, were similar in their savage nature.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Mexican antiquities were a number of terra-cotta figures
    which were thought to be emblematic of the worship of serpents,
    lizards, and other reptiles. There were also idols carved out of
    hard, volcanic stone. After having seen these, and also quantities of
    rudely shaped stones, which were probably used by the Indians on the
    north-east coast for sinking their nets, the Professor began to examine
    the various things that had been taken from the American shell mounds.</p>

  <p>First, in order, were the collections that had been brought from Maine
    and Massachusetts. There were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> oyster shells, the bones of wolves, deer
    and birds, fragments of coarse pottery, layers of charcoal, and bone
    awls. In the shell heaps at Concord there had been discovered various
    stone weapons and flint arrowheads. In the Florida mounds there were
    found the remains of crocodiles, implements made of stone, the bones of
    deer, and numbers of small sharp needles, made from bird bones, which
    had been used by hand.</p>

  <p>It appears from the evidence obtained by the investigation of the
    shell banks, that tribes of similar habits dwelt on the cold coasts
    of New England and the almost tropical shores of Florida. It is also
    clear, that in many of their customs and methods of obtaining food they
    resembled the races that formed the kitchen middens in Denmark. Their
    stone and flint implements and their bone awls and needles were of the
    same shapes as those used by the prehistoric people who lived upon the
    shores of the Swiss lakes.</p>

  <p>Many of the stone axes and arrowheads that have been found in
    the burial mounds, or in the neighbourhood of the ancient Indian
    encampments in North America are of the same type, and show the same
    system of workmanship as those that were made by the aboriginal tribes
    in Western Europe. The similarities in form, size and methods of
    adaptation for use are remarkable, for, although it may be expected
    that men, in an uncivilised condition would, in all parts of the
    world, have the same wants or necessities, yet it must be considered
    surprising that in the construction of the implements for war and for
    domestic purposes, the methods of design should be so singularly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>alike
    amongst the savages of the old and new continents.</p>

  <p>Upon a subsequent occasion, when the doubtful question of the influence
    of the formation of the skull upon the mind was discussed, Mr. Ticknor
    mentioned the singular fact that the head of Daniel Webster<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> grew
    larger after he had passed middle age. His attention had been drawn
    to this circumstance by observing a change in the likeness of that
    statesman, and, as he knew Webster intimately, he asked him about
    the matter, and Webster said, “Yes, I find that I have constantly to
    increase the size of my hats.”</p>

  <p>Towards the latter part of my stay in Boston, I received a letter from
    Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, asking me to dine with him at Concord, and
    mentioning that he had also invited Mrs. Julia Ward Howe. Upon the day
    he had fixed for the purpose, we travelled down to the station, and
    were met by Miss Emerson, who drove us home in her quaint old-fashioned
    carriage. The pony, she told us, was a friend who had been in the
    family for twenty years. We were received by Mr. and Mrs. Emerson. A
    few other guests came from Cambridge, and then we went in to dinner.
    Mr. Emerson talked much of De Quincey, whom he had known <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>at Lasswade,
    near Edinburgh, and then referring to our English poets, mentioned
    with admiration, Tennyson’s poem, “Tithonus.” One of his daughters
    spoke with enthusiasm about Professor Agassiz’s deep sea dredgings, the
    lectures upon which she had been attending.</p>

  <p>Finally, the (always) absorbing topic of American politics was dwelt
    upon, especially with respect to the effect of democratic institutions
    upon the character of the people. Mr. Emerson alluded with much sadness
    to those evil influences of political corruption and office-seeking
    which appeared to be inevitable blots upon all systems of democracy,
    but he said that he thought things would come right in the end. Upon
    the various occasions that I met and conversed with leading politicians
    (amongst whom was Chief Justice Chase), I observed that they usually
    spoke of the future of their country with the same anxiety.</p>

  <p>There was much doubt and uncertainty as to what was going to happen
    in the Southern States, which had so recently been made desolate.
    Men’s minds were still agitated by the memory of the serious events
    that had happened during the Civil War. That great national convulsion
    had engaged the thoughts and actions of all American citizens to the
    fullest extent, and had necessarily diverted the conduct of affairs
    from the ordinary channels. There was consequently a feeling of
    disquietude amongst those who loved their country, their freedom and
    their laws. But this temporary form of misgiving was always accompanied
    by the firm conviction that in some manner, not then quite clear, the
    nation would ultimately triumph over all difficulties.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

  <p>After dinner, Mr. Emerson took me into the library, and began to look
    over his books and point out his favourites. He said that what he most
    delighted in were the translations from Persian and other Eastern
    works. Finding that I was interested in his Oriental studies, he did
    not care to quit his books, and so we remained in the library until it
    was time to leave. In the meanwhile, he had taken down from the shelves
    many volumes. He also showed me photographs of his friends, and drew my
    attention to a likeness of Margaret Fuller, whom he had known for many
    years, and for whom he had felt great regard and esteem.</p>

  <p>Margaret Fuller, who must have been a woman of extraordinary
    genius, was one of the leaders of the school of thought called
    Transcendentalism. Her end was as strange as her life. She crossed
    the Atlantic, travelled in Italy, married the Marchese d’Ossoli and
    was in Europe when the Revolution of 1848 broke out. Her sympathies
    being entirely with the cause of Italian freedom, she took a prominent
    part, under the direction of Mazzini, Garibaldi and other patriots, in
    the defence of Rome, doing much good service in the hospitals. After
    the adverse events of 1849, she embarked with her husband on board a
    sailing vessel bound for her own land, on the shores of which she was
    wrecked in a storm and all perished.</p>

  <p>Before we went away, Mr. Emerson suggested that I should look at the
    exterior of the house, in which he seemed to take great interest. He
    told me that he had lived in it thirty-five years and had only made one
    change—the addition of the drawing room. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> was an unpretending plank
    building of two stories, standing in its own small grounds, and was
    chiefly noticeable in consequence of having some fine chestnut trees in
    front between the door and the road.</p>

  <p>Upon our return to the city, the President of the University asked me
    to be the guest of the Alumni of Harvard. His letter ran thus:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="right">“<i>June</i> 23.”</p>

    <p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,”</p>

    <p>“On behalf of the Alumni of Harvard College, I invite you to be
      present at the Commencement Dinner in Harvard Hall, Cambridge,
      on Tuesday, the 29th inst. The Alumni and their guests will
      assemble in Gore Hall, the Library, at 2 p.m. on that day. I
      hope to receive your acceptance, and to have the pleasure of
      meeting you on the occasion.”</p>

    <p class="right">“Very respectfully yours,<br />
      WM. GRAY,<br />
      <i>Pres. of Alumni Assoc.</i>”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At one of the customary afternoon meetings of the members of the
    Saturday Club, I dined with them as the guest of Dr. Howe. Among
    those present <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
    were Mr. Sumner, Professor Wyman, Mr. Lowell, Judge
    Hoar, Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Professor Gurney, the editor
    of the North American Review. Mr. Emerson was the chairman. The
    possibility of spontaneous generation, was the topic that happened to
    be chiefly discussed. Professor Wyman had been carrying out a series of
    experiments at Cambridge, and he told us what had been the results of
    his experience. He said that he had ascertained that the theory that
    boiling water killed life was, to a certain extent, erroneous. A first
    boiling killed some of the living creatures, a second boiling killed
    more, living organisms being reduced gradually in quantity. After a
    fourth severe boiling he failed to trace any life whatever. Finally
    after having carried out with great care, tests of all natures, he
    doubted the possibility of creating life where no life had previously
    existed.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the following year I accepted the invitation of Mr. Ticknor
      to stay a few days with him before leaving America, and I was
      fortunate in meeting at his house, Mr. Longfellow, who, at
      the time of my previous visit to Boston, was away from home,
      travelling in England, chiefly, as he afterwards told me,
      amongst the English lakes and in Devonshire. He proposed that
      I should go and see him at Cambridge, and this was arranged,
      and I went down there upon the first available day. I found
      him in his study, a small room looking out upon the lawn, and
      commanding a view of the country towards the bridge.</p>

    <p>Before dinner, he showed me a bill of fare which had been
      given to him at a public banquet in London, which was framed
      and placed on the mantel piece of the dining-room. It was
      a coloured drawing of a scene described in his poem of
      “Hiawatha.” The sun was shining on the still waters of a
      lake, or inland sea, and a group of Indians were gazing at
      it. I think it was meant to represent the final departure of
      Hiawatha, westwards towards the sunset.</p>

    <p>Mr. Longfellow said that he was much pleased with this mark of
      attention, not only on account of the merit of the picture, but
      because he appreciated the feeling that prompted the gift, as
      “Hiawatha” was the poem by which he most cared to be remembered.</p>

    <p>He expressed strong sympathies with the poetical legends and
      traditions of the Iroquois and Dakota Indians. His conversation
      was, however, chiefly directed to the question of the future
      social and political condition of the negroes in the Southern
      States.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>Later in the day, I witnessed a most important triumph of mechanics,
    as applied to the removal of a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
    heavy building. The house that was
    being moved was large and strongly constructed of stone. It stood at
    the corner of a street which was about to be widened, and therefore it
    was necessary, either to pull it down or place it in another position,
    and it had been decided to execute the latter operation. The building
    had a frontage of seventy feet and a depth of one hundred feet. It was
    composed of a basement, five principal stories and a Mansard roof.
    The engineer in charge of the works told me that his calculations
    were based upon having to move a weight of fifty thousand tons. At
    the time I saw the house, it was full of residents, many of whom were
    looking out of the windows and watching the proceedings. The contractor
    permitted me to go underneath and observe the process of moving. The
    weight was taken by a vast number of screw jacks, and the building was
    lifted off the foundations. It was progressing towards its new site at
    the rate of fourteen inches in one hour.</p>

  <p>On Commencement Day I went down to Cambridge early in the afternoon,
    and after being received by the President, fell into my place in the
    ranks of the procession formed in the college grounds. We then marched
    into dinner and I took my seat at the table. My immediate neighbours
    were Mr. Lowell, Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Judge Hoar and Judge Grey.
    About six hundred were present in the hall and three hundred dined in
    another room. The gradations of age corresponded with the positions of
    the tables. The seats towards the left were occupied by comparatively
    young men, but on the right, were successive rows of heads, showing
    advancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
    years, until upon the extreme right were the white haired seniors.</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of the dinner, in accordance with an ancient custom,
    all stood up and sang a Psalm to the tune known by the name of St.
    Martin. The President then gave his annual address and the usual
    speeches followed. Mr. Adams made a good speech and referred to his
    late absence as the United States Minister to Great Britain. The
    President then rose and told the Alumni that a “representative of Great
    Britain” was present and called upon me to respond. This I did as
    briefly as possible, and upon resuming my seat I was astonished at the
    enthusiastic manner with which the said representative was received.
    After much cheering, the band played “God save the Queen,” which was
    again the occasion for a strong outburst of cordial good feeling
    towards England. As I looked down the hall I saw the slight, tall form
    of Mr. Emerson bending forward as he joined in our National Anthem. Mr.
    Holmes then recited a poem and Mr. Lowell gave a speech in which he
    alluded to the question of the Alabama which was causing such bitter
    feeling in America, and after speaking of the volcanic ground into
    which he had wandered, said</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“O matre pulchra filia pulchrior,</div>
        <div class="i0">Pout if you will, but sulk not into war.</div>
        <div class="i0">Had Adams stayed, this danger had not been,</div>
        <div class="i0">This less than kindness of two more than kin.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The singing of “Auld Lang Syne” was the fitting conclusion to an
    interesting day.</p>

  <p>Professor Wyman told me that, before leaving the States, I ought to
    visit the shell mounds at Damariscotta in Maine and also those near
    Concord. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
    latter were considered to be remarkable on account of
    their being composed of fresh-water shells. Mr. Emerson had offered to
    help me in my examination of them, but not wishing to occupy his time
    in this unusual manner, I went down to Concord and tried to find them
    by myself. In this attempt I failed, and, finally, I decided to obtain
    his help. Fortunately, he was at home and at once put the harness on
    his pony and drove me down to the place. We crossed some fields and
    found the shell heaps near a sharp bend of the river. They were about a
    hundred and fifty yards long, twenty yards wide and twelve feet high,
    and were chiefly composed of mussel shells. For more than an hour we
    worked zealously and made slight excavations at different parts of the
    banks, and found some fragments of bones which had been shaped by hand,
    but we were not successful in seeing any stone celts. We then went to
    an adjoining hillock upon which the Indians were accustomed to encamp
    and there we picked up three rudely-made arrow heads which had been
    formed out of hard porphyritic stone.</p>

  <p>After finishing the inspection of the middens, we went back to the
    house, and remained for an hour or two in the library where we had tea.
    Mr. Emerson told me that in order to pass through, with comparative
    comfort, the long winter, he and others had formed a society of
    twenty-five members and arrangements were made for meeting at their
    respective houses. Each member gave a reception in turn upon Tuesdays.
    When the time was at hand for going to the train he went to the stable,
    and again harnessed the pony, and drove me to the station. When saying
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>“Good-bye,” he expressed many kind wishes with regard to my projected
    journey.</p>

  <p>Americans must naturally feel interested in whatever relates to the
    past history of the native races who were the original inhabitants of
    their country, and who possessed, in combination with their savage
    nature and cruel practices, certain qualities of honour and fortitude
    which seem to point to the existence of latent conditions of mind
    placing them upon a different footing from other ordinary savage races.
    Theories which relate to the migrations of the tribes who entered
    Mexico from the North have also much attraction. As years roll onwards,
    and the events, that then occurred, are more distant or obscure, the
    causes of those movements and the origin of the influences that created
    the subsequent advance in civilisation amongst those Indians are
    becoming almost incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>On the way from Concord towards Canada I stopped at Portsmouth for
    the purpose of seeing the Navy Yard,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which was the last naval
    establishment that I had to visit on the eastern coast, and then
    proceeded to the remotely situated village of Damariscotta.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

  <p>The shell mounds near the adjacent river far exceeded in magnitude
    what I had expected to find. They were placed about twelve miles from
    the sea within the limits of the ebb and the flow of the tides, and
    formed the banks of a small promontory round which the river made a
    sharp bend. Within these banks was a flat space of land which had been
    used by the Indians for their camping ground, and which is known to
    have been visited by small bands of them as late as the end of the last
    century. The heaps extend along the shores of the river and round the
    promontory for a length of about six hundred yards, and vary in height
    from fifteen to thirty-five feet. It was difficult to estimate their
    average width, but in many places it was not less than twenty-two yards.</p>

  <p>The mound that I chiefly examined rose directly from the beach close to
    the line of the present high water mark. It was thirty-three feet high,
    sixty feet wide and one hundred and fifty feet long. Looking <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>from the
    river, it presented the appearance of a steep cliff formed of compact
    layers of large oyster shells. In consequence of the face of this cliff
    being exposed, it was possible to trace all the horizontal strata.
    Beginning from the top of the bank there was, in the first place, a
    deposit of shells closely packed about eighteen inches thick. Then
    there was a well-defined layer of earth or mould, averaging a thickness
    of half-an-inch throughout the whole length of the bank without any
    break or change in its width. The next layer was not so deep as that on
    the top, and was one foot thick. Then came another deposit of mould,
    half-an-inch in thickness, resting upon another layer of shells. In
    this manner, the alternating deposits of earth and shells succeeded
    each other down to the base.</p>

  <p>There were not any signs of kitchen midden refuse amongst the shells,
    but in the intermediate layers of earth I saw fragments of broken
    pottery, charred wood, several rounded stones, small quantities of
    bones of animals, and one bone awl which had evidently been much used.
    A portion of the cliff which had been undermined by the action of the
    river had slipped down upon the beach, consequently the interior of the
    mound was exposed. I made an excavation into this new face and found a
    stone knife, or scraper, and a small stone chisel. In another part of
    the bank I discovered a plank lying flat upon the third layer of mould
    below the surface. It was made of fir, and was four feet six inches
    long, six inches wide and half-an-inch thick.</p>

  <p>These shell heaps, the relics of the feasts and food of the Indians,
    although interesting as evidences of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> the habits of life of the savage
    races that once occupied this part of America, prove but little more
    than the fact that those races have existed and passed away. The
    successive layers of earth in the heaps would enable an estimate to be
    made of their age, if the length of the intervals of time that elapsed
    between the encampments could be known. The saw-cut plank, resting upon
    the third layer is an evidence that the two upper deposits of shells
    were made since the arrival of the English colonists. The Indians then
    dwelling on these lands were called the Abenakis. These oyster heaps
    may have been raised by them when they visited the coast of Maine after
    leaving their hunting grounds.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">From</span> Damariscotta I went up the valley of the St. Lawrence, and visited
    the reservation lands of the Algonquins, Hurons, and other tribes
    that had originally held possession of that part of the country. The
    most important assemblage of Indians was placed upon a large tract
    of land near the banks of the Grand river in Upper Canada. There I
    saw, dwelling in their separate villages, the descendants of the once
    powerful confederacy of the Iroquois, who had been our faithful allies
    in our wars.</p>

  <p>Nearly three thousand Indians were gathered together belonging to
    the tribes of the Senecas, Onondagas, Mohawks, Cayugas, Oneidas and
    Tuscaroras. Some of them had been converted, but many still maintained
    their ancient faiths and performed their customary Pagan ceremonies.</p>

  <p>It was extraordinary to observe how unavailing had been the influence
    of European civilisation in advancing the intellectual capacities of
    the tribes. The French missionaries at Lorette, Oka, and St. Régis,
    many of whom were well acquainted with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
    language of the converts
    put under their care, told me that all their efforts were useless, and
    that the labours of nearly three centuries were absolutely without any
    practical result.</p>

  <p>After having passed a few weeks in the vicinity of the lakes, for the
    purpose of seeing the condition of various remnants of certain North
    American Indian tribes placed upon reservations, I reached the shores
    of the Georgian bay, and then proceeded to the port of Marquette in
    Michigan.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_035"><img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="600" height="388" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">Plan of the Lake Superior Iron and Copper region.</div>
  </div>

  <p>My chief object in landing upon the southern shores of Lake Superior,
    was to visit the places where ancient Indian mining operations had
    been discovered, in order that I might be, in some degree conversant
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
    with matters relating to the origin of the copper ornaments that had
    been found in some of the burial mounds in Ohio. I also wished to make
    some excursions into the forests where, amongst the numerous lakes and
    rivers, the beavers were still constructing their dams and building
    their lodges. I desired to see something of beaver life and work before
    the advance of civilisation had removed these forests and beavers away
    for ever.</p>

  <p>I obtained convenient quarters in the mining village of Ishpeming,
    placed in a clearing that had been made in the forest, on the summit of
    the hills ten miles from the coast. In the interior, within a few miles
    from the settlement were two rivers called the Carp and the Esconauba.
    Upon these streams and their connected ponds, the works of the beavers
    were numerous. They consisted of lodges, dams, canals, excavations, and
    the open spaces in the forests called beaver meadows.</p>

  <p>There happened to be an unusually large work constructed across one of
    the principal bends of the Carp, which by its action in confining the
    waters had created a small lake. As the size and formation of that dam
    give a good knowledge of the capacity of the beavers, and their powers
    of executing works of considerable magnitude, it will be interesting to
    describe it with some detail.</p>

  <p>It was two hundred and sixty-two feet in length and nearly six feet
    high in the centre, where the water was deep. This height diminished
    gradually towards the banks. The average width upon the top was two
    feet. The slope outwards was in the direction of the angle which
    happened to give the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
    utmost resisting power. The base was about
    fourteen feet wide. The dam was not made in a direct line across the
    stream, but had curves which were convex towards the current, and were
    placed at the points of the greatest pressure. The slopes were formed
    in such a manner that the upper side acted as a barrier against the
    water, and the opposite side acted as a supporting buttress.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Beaver Dam, Lodge, and Pond, near Ishpeming, Michigan.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The entire construction was evidently made with a correct knowledge
    of the strength that was necessary to resist the outward pushing
    force that was exerted against it. When an engineering work of this
    nature, so great in proportion to the power and intelligence of
    its constructors, is examined, and its fitness for the object for
    which it has been made and for the duty it has to perform, has been
    ascertained, it occurs to the mind to consider whether such operations
    are the results of instinct or of some exceptional degree of reasoning
    faculties.</p>

  <p>Within the pond was the lodge. It was placed near to the bank which by
    its curve gave the most shelter. It was shaped like a rounded beehive
    and measured nearly eight feet in diameter, and twenty-two feet over
    the outer circumference. The exterior was composed of small sticks cut
    in nearly equal lengths, and so intertwined, crossed and plastered with
    mud as to give great cohesion.</p>

  <p>There were three entrances, two of them leading in the direction of the
    bank, and one towards the middle of the pond. The former are said to be
    used as the approaches to the inner room, and the latter for escape.
    All these entrances were below the surface of the water, and ran
    upwards into the dwelling room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> which was a dry comfortable apartment,
    the floor being well above the highest water level.</p>

  <p>The beavers, when cutting the branches of the trees into the requisite
    lengths, seem to have an accurate perception of what is necessary for
    the special works that are then in progress. Thus in their lodges,
    which are chiefly made for shelter and warmth, the sticks composing
    them are small, and when well plastered together with mud make a
    good compact residence. The dams which have a different purpose are
    differently built, and in these the sticks are often of considerable
    size, being sometimes fully six feet long. Some of the cuttings,
    however, are small and many of them are like short poles, having a
    diameter about the size of a man’s arm.</p>

  <p>The methods of forming the foundations of their dams are most
    practical, and the manner in which earth, stones, mud, twigs, fibres
    and brushwood are combined, not only show marvellous ingenuity, but
    prove that beavers work perseveringly together with incessant labour
    for long periods of time.</p>

  <p>The superstructures are differently made. They are composed of a
    framework of sticks placed at various angles inclined upwards. This
    open form of disposition appears to be intended to allow the surface
    waters to escape to the extent that is necessary to keep the level of
    the pond at the uniform height that is desirable.</p>

  <p>Although it is usually considered that the intelligence of the beaver
    communities is chiefly shown by their ability in raising works of
    construction, I was informed by men who were intimately acquainted with
    the habits of these animals, that a greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> sagacity was displayed
    in the methods adopted by them, under especial circumstances, for
    maintaining communications between their dwelling places and the woods
    from which they obtained their food and building materials.</p>

  <p>These rare and singular works of excavation are called beaver canals.
    One of these, which was the largest that was known to occur in this
    part of Michigan, I examined with the utmost attention. It was an open
    trench or channel, about half a mile long, two to three feet wide,
    and from one to two feet deep. The bottom was of the same width as
    the surface, the sides being perpendicular. It connected a large pond
    with the adjacent forest. The canal was sufficiently large to give
    room for a beaver to swim in it and push in front of him the cutting
    of birchwood that was to be conveyed to the lodge and there stored for
    the winter supply of food. The depth was enough for the purpose of
    concealment.</p>

  <p>I also examined some other canals connecting the ponds with trees,
    which were of a different character and much smaller. The Indians were
    of opinion that these must have been made exclusively for escape when
    the beavers, whilst at work, were suddenly alarmed.</p>

  <p>But the most important results of the actions of the beavers are the
    alterations made by them in the aspect of the country, in consequence
    of their raising the levels of the water and causing large spaces of
    land to be subject to overflow. Thus, when the dams are in order and
    efficiently maintained, much of the adjoining land, when it lies low,
    becomes a swamp and the trees decay and fall. Then if the works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> are
    neglected and the waters follow their usual direction, the lands become
    dry and are changed into fertile grass meadows. Some of these meadows
    are of considerable extent. Around Ishpeming they supply the fodder
    required for the cattle employed at the mines. One of them, which
    occupies a large acreage, yields over fifty tons of hay annually.</p>

  <p>An explorer who happened to pass through a region of this nature after
    it had been deserted by the beavers, would be surprised, when following
    the trail through the forest, to find himself entering into one of
    these open spaces, which have the appearance of small savannahs, and he
    would be unable to understand how such sharply defined inclosures could
    have been formed.</p>

  <p>Near the borders of the meadows and ponds, several birches were
    undergoing the process of being felled. The operations were extremely
    curious, and it was evident that the beavers are both careful and
    ingenious in the execution of the work.</p>

  <p>The trees selected for their purposes are generally about three or
    four feet in circumference at the part that is within reach. The trunk
    of each tree is, in the first place, gnawed evenly round, until only
    a portion of the centre, about two inches in diameter, is left to
    maintain it in an upright position. It is then carefully gnawed from
    the direction towards which the tree is intended to fall, which is
    often a matter of some importance. When it is lying upon the ground,
    the bark is stripped and stored for food, the branches are cut into
    the requisite lengths and used also partly for winter provision, but
    chiefly with regard to what may be wanted for the construction and
    repair of the dams and lodges.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

  <p>Upon returning one afternoon from the River Carp, I found that, by some
    inattention, I had left the track and had wandered into the forest. Men
    who are accustomed to explore this region had stated that the safest
    course to adopt when such an event occurred was to observe the position
    of the marks of the weather upon the trunks of the trees. In Michigan,
    it held been noticed that these evidences of exposure, consisting of
    moss or lichen, were upon the Northern sides, and it was considered
    that by watching these indications, a line of direction could be
    followed.</p>

  <p>It is possible that in places where the trees are much exposed this
    system may be useful, but in this case I did not find it so.</p>

  <p>The indications of weather were often very faint and difficult to
    trace. Where they did clearly exist, they varied so greatly in
    their position, that it was impossible to follow a straight line. I
    consequently soon gave up the attempt to find the trail by this method.
    Night was approaching, and the outlook was becoming grave. In all
    directions but one, there was nothing but many miles of dense forest,
    which it would be hopeless to attempt to pass through.</p>

  <p>The direction which was available had a broad base, being the road
    from Ishpeming to Marquette. This I knew must lie between south and
    south-west. Consequently if I could follow a line between these points,
    it was probable that the road would soon be reached, as its distance
    was less than three miles. I had my watch with me, and fortunately,
    the sun could be seen occasionally, so it was possible to make that my
    guide.</p>

  <p>Upon a rough calculation of the true bearing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> the approaching
    sunset, I found that by keeping the glimmer of the light on the right
    hand, and walking steadily forward, the road ought to be reached before
    dark. It was, however, anxious work and it was getting late when I
    unexpectedly emerged into an open clearing, where a squatter had
    temporarily settled. It was with no slight pleasure that I heard the
    sounds of life, the lowing of cattle, and the welcome movements of a
    busy farmyard.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

  <p>After concluding my expeditions to the lands and ponds of the beavers,
    I went to that part of Michigan where the ancient mining pits and
    trenches have been discovered. The earliest knowledge of them was
    obtained by an American explorer who, in the year 1847, when seeking
    for indications of metal ore, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>noticed several depressions in the
    ground, and saw lying in a heap, near what seemed to be an ancient
    excavation, a number of rude stone hammers that he thought had probably
    been used by hand.</p>

  <p>In the following year another excavation was discovered, and after
    clearing this out to a depth of eighteen feet, there was found a
    detached mass of copper weighing over six tons which rested upon oak
    sleepers, and beneath it there was a vein of copper five feet thick.
    There were also several stone hammers, grooved for the purpose of
    having handles attached to them, and a copper chisel with a socket for
    a wooden handle, a fragment of which although much decayed, was still
    in its place. In an adjoining pit at a depth of ten feet, there was
    a wooden bowl and some charcoal.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In some workings, subsequently
    discovered upon Isle Royale and near the end of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>the Kee-wai-wona
    promontory, a number of wooden wedges were seen, together with traces
    of extensive trenches.</p>

  <p>In consequence of these discoveries further investigations were
    made, and a large number of ancient pits were found in the forests,
    especially in the districts where are now placed the towns of Ontonagon
    and Houghton. It was within a few miles from the latter town, that the
    explorers observed the heap of stone hammers, and their attention was
    directed to the fact that they had been preceded in the search for
    copper by men of some unknown race, who possessed capacities for mining
    operations greater than could be attributed to the Chippewas who then
    occupied the land.</p>

  <p>In order to examine this heap I engaged a man—who knew the mining and
    forest region—to guide me to the spot where the hammers still remained.
    After crossing the Portage Lake and passing over some low neighbouring
    hills, we came to a depression in the ground which looked like an old
    ditch or trench. At the side of this ditch, I saw several hundreds of
    rounded water-worn stones of various sizes. These had evidently been
    chosen on account of the convenience of their shape, for the purpose of
    being used for crushing the rocks that contained metal.</p>

  <p>A few of the stones appeared to have been partly shaped by hand,
    but the majority of them were in their natural form. Several were
    perforated by small round holes, caused probably by the action of
    water. Some men who happened to be employed at one of the mines in the
    neighbourhood, told me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> that in their opinion they had been made for
    thumb holes. They were, however, much too small for such a purpose.</p>

  <p>Upon my return to Houghton I met Mr. I. H. Forster, who was the agent
    for mines and a Senator for the State. He proposed to accompany me to
    the sites of those ancient workings that he had personally inspected.
    After passing through a forest of birch and pine trees, we reached an
    open space where we saw the evidences of the nature of the operations
    that had been executed.</p>

  <p>The direction of the trenches could be easily traced, although they
    were filled with earth and leaves. Several of the pits had been cleared
    out by the men employed at one of the new mines, and it was therefore
    possible to go down to the bottom of them and observe the methods of
    excavation. The first that I examined was twelve feet deep; from the
    base there ran two nearly horizontal galleries or adits, following the
    direction of the lode which ran N.W. and S.E. These adits were five
    feet wide and extended laterally about six feet. Upon the surface, near
    the edge of the pit, was the stump of a basswood tree, six feet in
    circumference, and at the opposite edge was the stump of a pine, four
    feet in circumference.</p>

  <p>The second pit was twenty yards from the first, and had evidently been
    sunk in the direction required in order to reach the same lode. It was
    ten feet deep. From the base there was one adit following the direction
    of the deposit of copper. Close to the edge of this pit was the stump
    of a small birch tree. Beyond this were seven other pits, from twenty
    to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> fifty yards apart, and in connection with these, there were several
    short trenches from two to four feet wide.</p>

  <p>The pits were discovered in 1865. Some animals were being driven along
    a track in the forest, when one of them straying from the path, plunged
    his feet deep into the ground; this was noticed, and an explorer for
    copper examined the place and pushed his stick down it. This led to a
    further search, and the hole was found to be an ancient pit. Shafts
    were sunk, and the result has been, that, one of the most important
    mines in the district was established near the spot.</p>

  <p>Upon another occasion I went with Mr. Forster to look at the trenches
    and pits that had been found in a more distant part of the forest.
    These pits were smaller than those that I had previously seen, but the
    trenches were frequently of considerable depth. I measured several that
    exceeded six feet deep. These trenches were usually in short lengths,
    but one of them was nearly two hundred feet long. Upon making inquiries
    amongst the leading men of the various copper mines that have been
    placed in the neighbourhood of the earlier workings, I was told that
    the practical miners were of opinion that these excavations were of
    considerable antiquity. It has, however, been proved by the condition
    of the things that were found in the pits that these conjectures are
    not well founded.</p>

  <p>Near Ontonagon, to the south-west of Portage Lake, a line of trenches
    was observed in 1863, and a shaft was sunk in a depression which was
    considered to be an old pit. At a depth of nine feet, one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
    workmen drew out upon the point of his pickaxe, a small untanned
    leather bag in a good state of preservation. It was noticed that the
    mouth of the bag was traversed by a leather string, which was in its
    place and could be used for drawing the opening together. The bag was
    seven inches wide and eleven inches deep.</p>

  <p>Two years afterwards, some men exploring the same part of the forest,
    observed a small mound about six feet high. After digging through
    it down to the ground, they reached the surface of a pit, which was
    carefully excavated by them. At the top there was a deposit of sand;
    below that, were many closely pressed layers of decayed leaves. At
    the bottom of the pit they saw a birch bark basket, in all respects,
    similar to those that are made and used by the modern Chippewas. Near
    the basket they also found a bit of beaver or otter skin with the fur
    upon it, portions of the jaw of a bear, several pieces of charcoal, a
    beating block—fourteen inches square and three inches thick—made out
    of a lump of copper conglomerate, some lengths of knotted strips of
    buckskin, and a rough bit of wood about three feet long, which the
    miners call a digging stick. A collection of these things had been
    placed in an office at Houghton, where I saw them. I noticed that the
    digging stick was worn and frayed at the end where it had been used,
    and that the fur on the beaver skin was still in good condition.</p>

  <p>In the same forest country as that where the pits were dug, several
    copper spear heads have been picked up. Those examined by me were
    unquestionably made by persons skilled in the working <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>of metal.
    Several of the members attached to the mission at Sault Ste.
    Marie,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
    in the early part of the eighteenth century, made crosses and ornaments
    from copper that was brought to them by Indians, who had found small
    lumps of the metal on the surface of the ground. The spear heads may
    have been made at the mission house.</p>

  <p>After the cession of the Canadas to Great Britain in 1763, an English
    Company was formed for the purpose of searching for metal in this
    region. The operations were conducted by Mr. Alexander Henry, and it
    has been ascertained that for several years he worked near Ontonagon,
    and at other places upon the Kee-wai-wona promontory. Judging from the
    method in which, at the ancient workings, the lodes of copper have
    been traced through dense forests, it is evident that fixed plans of
    operations must have been pursued, and I came to the conclusion that
    the surveyor who directed them, must have had a competent knowledge of
    the use of the compass. It is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>therefore not unreasonable to assume,
    that all the pits and trenches were excavated under the superintendence
    of Europeans, at some period later than the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>Several miles to the south of these works I was shown the spot
    where the last and decisive battle was fought between the Chippewas
    and Iroquois. This battle field, which was on a point of land near
    Kee-wai-wona bay, was remarkable because it affords an instance of
    the great distances that were sometimes traversed by Indians when
    conducting their wars of extermination. The Iroquois whose territories
    and villages were upon the southern shores of Lakes Ontario and Erie,
    crossed into the Chippewa lands by the way of the channels leading to
    Sault Ste. Marie. Therefore, supposing that they followed the most
    direct line to the place where the battle was fought, they must have
    passed over a distance of not less than six hundred miles.</p>

  <p>One of the burial mounds which had been opened, contained a large
    skull, a pipe made of dark slate and a stone hatchet. Upon the
    top of the mound was a pine tree which measured thirty inches in
    circumference. The scattered descendants of the Chippewa tribes dwell
    in the districts to the west of Lake Superior, but they occasionally
    wander into their original country. I met some of them near the shores
    of that great inland sea.</p>

  <p>During the time that I was travelling in these iron and copper regions,
    I took the opportunity of accompanying the superintendent of one of the
    mines to look at the evidences of the action of the glacial drift upon
    the surfaces of the hills that had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> cleared for the purpose of
    executing some preliminary mining operations. Some of these hills were
    composed of solid hematite iron and jasper, and yet these hard rocks
    were deeply grooved by the pressure that had been exerted against them.</p>

  <p>Near Ishpeming there was a low range of hills or knobs, whose formation
    was a compact greenstone with wide veins of iron, which had been
    subjected to a severe grinding, and was furrowed with grooves two feet
    wide and five and a half inches deep. The general direction of this
    range was from E.N.E. to W.S.W. and the action of pressure was greatest
    where the sides of the hills faced towards the north. The grooves were
    about nine hundred feet above the level of Lake Superior. Large erratic
    boulders covered the surface of the land. I measured one of them which
    was lying exposed in a depression between two conical hills, eight
    hundred and fifty feet above the lake. It must have weighed over twenty
    tons. The boulders were usually masses of basalt, black or red granite,
    porphyry and jasper. Rounded boulders of pure copper are sometimes
    found. One of these, of exceptional size, was in the forest, in the
    direction of Ontonagon, and was estimated to weigh about eighteen tons.</p>

  <p>Near Houghton, Mr. Forster showed me the surface of a hill, four
    hundred feet above the lake, which had been made perfectly smooth by
    the action of the drift passing over it. At another part where the rock
    was exposed we counted fifty-seven grooves over a space of sixty-seven
    feet of surface. Judging from the direction of the groovings on the
    Kee-wai-wona promontory and the iron hills of Michigan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
    the boulders appear to have been carried from Labrador.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption smcap">Chippewa Chief.<br />(west of lake superior.)</div>
  </div>

  <p>The waters and floating icebergs must have swept over this country with
    much force for in many places the pressure exerted seems to have been
    enormous.</p>

  <p>On my way south from this land, which contained so much that attracted
    attention, I visited the reservation of the Oneidas, at the spot where
    the council fire of that tribe was originally established, near Lake
    Ontario. I was received by the hereditary chief of that tribe, who
    was named Beech-tree. As he could not speak a word of English, our
    conversation was carried on with the assistance of his grandson, who
    acted as interpreter. Beech-tree was a large, broad shouldered man,
    with a remarkably massive head. If I had met him in the north of China,
    I should have taken him for a Manchu Tartar. His hair was very long and
    black, and tinged with grey.</p>

  <p>He told his grandson to say that he was proud of his unmixed descent
    from the ancient chiefs of his nation, which had once been powerful,
    and that the land upon which we stood belonged by right to the Oneidas,
    and was the place where they held their great councils and decided
    upon questions of war or peace. After having made, with assumed
    dignity, this brief oration, Beech-tree retired into the interior of
    his hut, and I returned to my country cart, which had conveyed me to
    his territory, and finally reached the shores of Lake Erie. After
    traversing Lakes Huron and Michigan, I proceeded to the banks of the
    Ohio river, with the purpose of making expeditions to the works of the
    Mound Builders.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

  <p>Before quitting the Oneida reservation, I made inquiries about a man
    named Williams, concerning whom I had heard, when at Boston, a strange
    and romantic story. It appears that Williams, whose parentage was
    uncertain or unknown, was sent early in the present century from the
    Indian village of St. Régis, to act as a missionary among the Oneidas.
    Some years later, rumours were spread to the effect that he was the
    true Dauphin, the son of Louis XVI. These rumours were stated to be
    based upon grounds which warranted a fair degree of belief.</p>

  <p>The story as told to me at Oneida was that Williams was supposed to
    have been born at St. Régis (a picturesque village reservation on the
    South bank of the St. Lawrence, and which, at the time that I saw it,
    contained a population of fifteen hundred Iroquois, the majority of
    whom were half-breeds).</p>

  <p>In early manhood he was sent to a college, trained for missionary work,
    and ultimately appointed to preach among the Oneidas. I was informed,
    by those who had previously known him, that he was an honest, zealous
    missionary, who was quite incapable of attempting any form of imposture.</p>

  <p>It however happened (such is the story,) that the Prince de Joinville,
    when travelling in America, came to Oneida and saw Williams. It is also
    stated that he visited him on a second occasion. After this second
    meeting, it was thought by the residents in the neighbourhood, that
    Williams was possibly the Dauphin.</p>

  <p>A picture of Simon, the gaoler who treated the young prisoner in
    the Temple with such incredible brutality, was shown to him, and he
    instantly started back with horror, as if recalling some painful
    memory. Williams had no recollection of anything about his youth before
    the age of fourteen.</p>

  <p>In consequence of these apparent corroborations of the local surmises,
    it was conjectured that after the execution of Louis XVI., the young
    Dauphin was removed from the prison, sent to America and placed in an
    Indian family at St. Régis. Williams lived for many years with the
    Oneidas, and died at an advanced age. He was described as having been
    a man of portly physique, with large features and big hands and feet.
    His complexion was rather dark. I think it is probable that he was
    descended from half-breed Indian parents.</p>

  <p>It will be observed, that, the whole value of the evidence supporting
    the theory of his being the Dauphin, depends upon the accuracy
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> of the
    story that he received two visits from the Prince de Joinville. This
    statement, if correct, appears however to establish the presumption
    that the Royal Family of France, may have had some doubts with regard
    to the truth of the report of the death of Louis XVII. in the Temple.
    It is certain that a boy, said to have been that young prince, was
    buried by the orders of the Commune in an obscure churchyard in the
    Faubourg St. Antoine, in the year 1795; but the evidence is scarcely
    conclusive upon the subject.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> great earthworks in Ohio are the subject of much antiquarian
    interest and conjecture. Several surveys of them have been made for the
    purpose of ascertaining their purpose and the probable period of their
    construction, but nothing definite has yet been determined.</p>

  <p>In considering the various theories respecting the migrations of
    the aboriginal tribes, it is strange that traces of the same kind
    of encampments have not been found either in the North-West towards
    Asia, or in the southern parts of the valley of the Mississippi. It
    is difficult to understand how it happens that these works only occur
    within a comparatively confined region. Their actual geographical
    limits are contained within an area bounded approximately, towards the
    South, by the left bank of the river Ohio, from the neighbourhood of
    Cincinnati towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
    West, to Wheeling towards the East, and not
    extending northwards beyond a line drawn from East to West through the
    centre of Ohio.</p>

  <p>Consequently it will be seen, upon making a reference to the map, that
    the works of the people called the Mound Builders, are situated within
    the southern division of the State including both banks of the Ohio
    river. These were their extreme limits, but the part of the country
    chiefly occupied by them has a much lesser area.</p>

  <p>It is evident from the positions of the earthworks, that the tribes
    which raised them thought it necessary to maintain their communications
    by water with the valley of the Ohio, and on the banks of that river
    they had several important fortifications or encampments. It is,
    however, upon the banks of the tributaries that fall into the Ohio from
    the North, that their settlements were most numerous, especially upon
    the Scioto, the Muskinghum and the streams entering those rivers near
    Newark and Chillicothe.</p>

  <p>The first earthwork that I visited was the great mound of Miamisburgh,
    which is situated upon the summit of high ground overlooking the
    valley of the Little Miami river. It was opened and examined in 1869,
    a few months before I saw it. In appearance and shape it resembled the
    largest of the Tumuli that were raised upon the plains of Troy, but the
    dimensions of this American mound are much greater. It is sixty-eight
    feet high, and has a circumference at the base of about eight hundred
    and thirty feet.</p>

  <p>A perpendicular shaft was sunk from the centre of the summit to the
    centre of the base, and two horizontal shafts were made, one at
    eighteen feet, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
    another at thirty-six feet respectively. At a
    depth of four feet from the top, there was a layer of wood ashes. At
    eight feet there was discovered a skeleton and some decayed wood. At
    fifteen feet there was a layer of charcoal and lime. At the depth of
    twenty-four feet a singular construction was found. It consisted of an
    upright stone, standing upon two flat stones, together with a number of
    rounded water-worn stones. With these there was some closely pressed
    material, looking like a kind of cloth made from wood fibre. Upon
    reaching the depth of thirty feet, there was discovered a quantity of
    charcoal and ashes. Six feet below this was a hollow space and, from
    the character of the contents within, it was supposed that there must
    have been a vault there, which had been surrounded and covered with
    logs of wood. At the base of the mound there was a large quantity of
    charcoal.</p>

  <p>Before the tumulus was opened, it had been conjectured that it was
    raised by the Indians for the purposes of observation. It is situated
    at the extreme western limit of the territories of the Mound Builders,
    and at a considerable distance from any of their other earthworks.
    The other great burial mound was placed in a similar manner beyond
    the eastern boundary at the confluence of a small stream called the
    Grave Creek with the Ohio, near Wheeling. On my way there by the
    river, I passed the mouths of the Scioto and Muskinghum, and the towns
    of Portsmouth and Marietta,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> where are the remains of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>extensive
    encampments.</p>

  <p>The Grave Creek Mound is similar to that at Miamisburgh, but it is, in
    all its measurements, rather larger and rises to a height of seventy
    feet. In the early part of the present century, some slight excavations
    were made upon the slopes, and it was then ascertained that numerous
    skeletons were buried there.</p>

  <p>In the year 1838, a more thorough system of examination was adopted.
    A shaft was carried through horizontally from the surface of the
    ground at the base to the centre. Then a perpendicular shaft was sunk
    from the centre of the summit to the base, connecting these with the
    passage already opened. At three feet from the summit there was found
    a skeleton in a complete state of decay. Thirty-two feet lower down,
    there was a small vault or structure of logs of wood, within which was
    another skeleton also decayed. At the base there was a larger vault,
    containing two skeletons which were in a sufficiently well preserved
    condition to enable them, subsequently, to be exhibited. These
    skeletons were found to be partly enveloped in a fibrous material, and
    they were placed within a structure, formed by a number of upright logs
    of wood, covered by other similar logs placed horizontally. Upon the
    top of this roof there had been piled a small heap of stones.</p>

  <p>The excavation of the horizontal shaft, near the surface, disclosed a
    very singular system of burial.</p>

  <p>Dr. Clemens,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in his account of this operation,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>states that at a
    distance of twelve or fifteen feet were found masses of a substance
    composed of charcoal and burnt bones, and also that when enlarging the
    lower vault, in which were the two skeletons, ten more skeletons were
    discovered, all of them in a sitting posture, but in a state so fragile
    as to defy all attempts to preserve them. In this lower vault there
    were six hundred and fifty beads made of shell and perforated in the
    centre. In the smaller vault above, in which was the single skeleton,
    there were seventeen hundred shell beads, about one hundred and fifty
    small plates of mica perforated at their sides and corners, five
    hundred marine shells and five copper bands or bracelets which were
    placed on the bones of the arms.</p>

  <p>There was a tree growing upon the top of the mound which interfered
    with the operations. Dr. Clemens stated that it was two-and-a-half
    feet in diameter, and had three hundred growths from centre to
    circumference. Some years earlier another oak which had become decayed
    was cut down by the proprietor, who said that he had counted upon it
    nearly five hundred annual rings. The number of rings in the trunk of
    a tree, growing upon any part of the mound, gives clear evidence upon
    the question of its least age, and therefore it may be assumed that the
    date of the completion of the burial mound cannot be later than the
    fourteenth century. It is, however, possible that there may have been
    several successive growths of trees on the slopes, and in that case it
    may have been raised at some earlier period. The Miamisburgh mound, at
    the time when I saw it, was covered with trees, none of which appeared
    to be of great age.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
    They must have been preceded by other growths.</p>

  <p>The nature of the ornaments buried with the skeletons in the Grave
    Creek mound, seems to prove that there must have been communications
    between these Ohio races, and the tribes dwelling to the South of
    the Mississippi valley,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> for the small sea shells were considered
    to be of the same kind as those seen on the beaches in Florida. The
    glittering flat slabs of mica, which hung over the breast, either as
    ornaments or marks of distinction, were similar to those discovered in
    burial mounds in the Iroquois country, near Lake Ontario. The copper
    bracelets were of rude workmanship, and were probably hammered into
    their shape from lumps of native copper. Similar bracelets have been
    found <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
    in some smaller burial mounds in other parts of Ohio. Those
    examined by me were made in the most rough and simple manner. The
    copper seems to have been beaten out into the required lengths, and
    then bent over to form the bracelets. The shapes resembled the bangles
    made in Hindostan and Persia.</p>

  <p>There are circumstances with respect to the manner of burial by the
    Mound Builders which require to be noticed. It seems from the evidence
    of the various excavations that have been made, that it was frequently
    the custom to construct in the centre of the spot intended to be a
    burial place, a vault surrounded by upright logs of wood. In this was
    put the earliest burial, which was probably that of a chief. This vault
    was then covered with a roof of logs, and over it was piled a heap of
    stones. Other mounds were added in the course of time, and were placed
    on the surface of the ground in a circle surrounding the vault. This
    system of placing mounds was then continued in circles, one outside
    the other, until the space or area intended to be occupied was filled
    up. The later interments were probably made successively one above the
    other, until the tumulus was completed. The time that would elapse
    before a tribe had raised such a high mound as that at the Grave Creek,
    would necessarily be very long.</p>

  <p>In the town of Newark, situated in a part of the country which appears
    to have been much occupied by the races that built the ancient
    earthworks, a very interesting collection of local antiquities had been
    brought together. Amongst the various relics discovered in the mounds
    were, stone axes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
    chisels, quantities of rude coarse pottery, many
    shell beads, and some copper bracelets.</p>

  <p>Dr. Wilson, who was a resident in the neighbourhood, and took much
    personal interest in antiquarian investigations, told me he had
    observed that the larger burial places seemed to have been raised
    gradually, and at intervals. He had formed the opinion that the
    Indians usually traced upon the surface of the ground the outer base
    of the tumulus. Within the inclosed space a number of skeletons were
    then laid and covered over with layers of earth or small mounds. Over
    these, after a certain time had elapsed, more skeletons were placed
    and similarly covered. This system of burial was continued until the
    mound was completed. There were evidences of a great burning having
    taken place upon the top of every successive series of burials. The
    nature of the contents of such of the smaller mounds as had been opened
    varied in many respects. In some instances nothing was found except
    ashes and broken pottery. In others were skeletons together with stone
    pipes, chisels made of hard greenstone, flint arrow heads, bone awls
    and numerous beads. There were also occasionally found a few rudely
    made copper rings. In a mound which was supposed to be a child’s grave,
    a necklace of beads, strung upon a kind of fibre, was placed round the
    neck of the skeleton.</p>

  <p>There was a large cairn, above forty feet in height, placed a few
    miles south of the town, which was destroyed about the middle of the
    present century in order to obtain materials for constructing a portion
    of the banks of a canal. When the stones were removed, fifteen small
    mounds composed of earth were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
    discovered ranged in a circle at some
    distance from the centre, and near the outer part of the base. There
    was also a central mound which contained a quantity of human bones. In
    one of the outer mounds the explorers saw a hollow wooden trough, in
    which was a skeleton and several rings made of copper. I examined some
    fragments of this trough that were preserved in the Museum. The wood
    was black and very hard. It was considered that the mounds beneath the
    cairn contained earth that must have been brought from a distance. This
    singular fact is in accordance with what has been observed in other
    Indian works, and probably has a special significance.</p>

  <p>Judging from the character of the relics that have been discovered
    in the Ohio mounds,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> it does not appear that there is any reason
    to justify the conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
    that the Mound Builders differed in
    their condition of civilisation from the other Indian tribes. The
    consideration of this subject has been made perplexing in consequence
    of the existence of the numerous burial places of the tribes who were
    settled in this region after the arrival of the Europeans. In several
    mounds were found gunbarrels, silver crosses and other objects which
    are undoubtedly of foreign workmanship. The crosses were usually placed
    upon the breasts of the skeletons, and from this circumstance it is
    probable that they belonged to Indians who had been converted by the
    French missionaries.</p>

  <p>After I had seen the principal burial places of the Mound Builders, I
    proceeded to look at the largest and most important group of that class
    of earthworks, which were considered by Messrs. Squier and Davis, who
    surveyed them in 1845, to have been raised for the purpose of religious
    ceremonial, and who accordingly called them sacred inclosures. It has
    also been conjectured that they may have been fortified camps.</p>

  <p>They are situated a few miles from Newark, upon a slightly elevated
    plain, about forty feet above a river now called the Licking Creek.
    Upon two sides of them there are smaller streams, respectively named,
    South Fork and Racoon Creek: thus the camps are surrounded on three
    sides by water. The site chosen by the Indians was well adapted for
    the purpose of defence, when the habits or requirements of the tribes
    were such as to make it desirable for them to establish their dwelling
    places as near as possible to a river. The inclosures are designed
    with skill, and their construction must have involved arduous and long
    continued labour, which was probably <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
    executed in consequence of the
    apprehension of serious danger from the attacks of enemies. Upon an
    examination of their formation, it becomes evident that the men who
    traced the lines of the embankments, followed clear and well-defined
    rules.</p>

  <p>As these earthworks are, with respect to their principles of
    construction, the most remarkable of their kind in North America, it
    is expedient to investigate their plans with careful attention. The
    inclosure, which is marked A on the annexed ground plan, consists
    of a large octagonal work connected with a smaller circular work.
    The octagon contains an area of about forty acres, surrounded by an
    embankment whose existing average height slightly exceeds five feet.
    There are eight entrances or gateways placed at equal distances from
    each other. They are guarded by mounds, made sufficiently wide to
    extend a little beyond the width of the openings and thus cover the
    approach. These mounds are of the same height as the ramparts, and are
    placed within them. They were made flat upon the top, and possibly the
    platform thus made was useful for defensive operations.</p>

  <p>At one end of the inclosure the ramparts leave the octagon, and form
    two parallel banks leading into the circle B. This approach
    is nearly one hundred yards long and about fifteen yards wide. At its
    termination the banks turn to the right and left, and form a circular
    work containing an area of twenty acres. At the outer edge of the
    circle and opposite to the entrance, is placed a large flat-topped
    mound, attached to, but outside the general line of the banks. This
    mound, according to my measurements, was twelve feet in perpendicular
    height, and had a platform on its summit which was about one hundred
    and eighty feet long by thirty feet wide. In consequence of being
    several feet higher than the embankments and outside their line, it
    commands the approaches to that part of the inclosure. There is no
    exterior or interior ditch to either of these works.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>

    <div class="caption"><i>Plan of Indian Inclosures and Parallel Embankments
      near Newark, Ohio</i></div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

  <p>From the central, or eastern opening of the octagon a long low line
    of parallel embankments connect it with another group of earthworks
    which, in the plan, is marked C. The inclosure has been, in
    many parts, destroyed or levelled, but it is possible to trace its
    original form. It appears to have been an exact square, containing
    an area of twenty acres. This square is connected with the circular
    work D by parallel banks in the same manner as the octagon
    is joined to the circle B, but they are of greater length
    and magnitude. At the entrance, where the banks diverge outwards and
    begin to form the curve of the circle, they rise to a height exceeding
    fifteen feet.</p>

  <p>The appearance of these great avenues of approach, and the inclosing
    banks, covered with forest trees, is very impressive, and it can be
    well understood why it has been thought probable that the circular
    work was raised for the purpose of performing religious or sacrificial
    ceremonies. With respect to that opinion it should be observed that, in
    this particular instance, the theory that the lofty banks were intended
    as a fortification is to some extent doubtful, because it happens that
    the ditch is placed within the ramparts. This method of defence is
    unquestionably <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
    opposed to all the rules of European fortification.
    Possibly in the systems of Indian warfare where stockades were
    generally used, and sometimes placed on the sides of sloping banks, an
    inner ditch may have been considered more capable of defence than one
    placed externally.</p>

  <p>The inclosure, like that at B, is in the shape of a circle.
    It contains an area of about twenty-six acres. The ramparts have an
    average height of nearly twelve feet, and the depth of the ditch is
    over nine feet. At that part of the work which is near the entrance,
    the dimensions are, however, of still greater importance, and the
    perpendicular height measured from the bottom of the ditch exceeds
    twenty-eight feet. The length of the inner slope may be estimated as
    being about forty-two feet. In the centre of the inclosure, there is a
    low heap of earth and stones which, in consequence of its shape, has
    received the name of the eagle mound. It is not improbable that this
    was the spot where, after the Indians returned from their wars, their
    prisoners were tied to a stake, then tortured, and burnt in accordance
    with the usual customs, and war dances with other savage ceremonies,
    were performed in the presence of the women and children assembled
    around.</p>

  <p>When taking into consideration the various circumstances which are
    apparent in the<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>Newark <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
    inclosures, particular attention should be
    given to the fact that their ground plans are geometrical figures.
    Thus the circle B is accurately traced. D has some small difference
    in the lengths of its diameters, but is very nearly a true circle.
    The square has its four sides equal, and all its angles are right
    angles. The octagon is carefully laid down, and its angles are almost
    mathematically correct.</p>

  <p>The plans and measurements are evidences of the existence of mental
    capacities which were far in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
    advance of those of the present Indian
    races, who are remarkable for their extreme indifference to all ideas
    of regularity of form, and who have not, and never could have had, the
    slightest acquaintance with the rules of geometry.</p>

  <p>The Licking river, after passing these inclosures, finally enters the
    Muskinghum, and the Muskinghum falls into the Ohio. The confluence
    takes place near the town of Marietta, where there are groups of
    earthworks which, in many respects, resemble those at Newark, and
    some of the areas were equal. The positions for the inclosures
    were evidently chosen upon similar principles. They were upon a
    comparatively elevated plateau, and had direct communication with the
    river.</p>

  <p>In the early part of the present century some discoveries were made,
    which were considered to be of the utmost importance. It was thought
    that they had a direct bearing upon the question of the civilisation
    and antiquity of the Mound Builders, and a letter, written by Dr.
    Hildreth, has been acknowledged to be a very important contribution to
    the evidence upon these subjects.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

  <p>The letter ran as follows:-</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="right">“Marietta, July 19th, 1819.</p>

    <p>“In removing the earth which composed an ancient mound in one
      of the streets of Marietta, on the margin of the plain, near
      the fortifications, several curious articles were discovered
      the latter part of June last. They appear to have been buried
      with the body of the person to whose memory this mound was erected.</p>

  </div>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
      “Lying immediately over, or on the forehead of the body, were
      found three large circular bosses, or ornaments for a sword
      belt, or a buckler; they are composed of copper, overlaid
      with a thick plate of silver. The fronts of them are slightly
      convex, with a depression, like a cup, in the centre, and
      measure two inches and a quarter across the face of each. On
      the back side, opposite the depressed portion, is a copper
      rivet or nail, around which are two separate plates, by which
      they were fastened to the leather. Two small pieces of the
      leather were found lying between the plates of one of the
      bosses; they resemble the skin of an old mummy, and seem to
      have been preserved by the salts of the copper. The plates of
      copper are nearly reduced to an oxyde, or rust. The silver
      looks quite black, but is not much corroded, and on rubbing,
      it becomes quite brilliant. Two of these are yet entire; the
      third one is so much wasted, that it dropped in pieces on
      removing it from the earth. Around the rivet of one of them
      is a small quantity of flax or hemp, in a tolerable state of
      preservation. Near the side of the body was found a plate of
      silver which appears to have been the upper part of a sword
      scabbard; it is six inches in length and two inches in breadth,
      and weighs one ounce; it has no ornaments or figures, but has
      three longitudinal ridges, which probably corresponded with
      edges, or ridges of the sword; it seems to have been fastened
      to the scabbard by three or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
      four rivets, the holes of which yet remain in the silver.</p>

    <p>“Two or three broken pieces of a copper tube, were also found,
      filled with iron rust. These pieces, from their appearance,
      composed the lower end of the scabbard, near the point of the
      sword. No sign of the sword itself was discovered, except the
      appearance of rust above mentioned.</p>

      <p>“Near the feet, was found a piece of copper, weighing three
      ounces. From its shape it appears to have been used as a plumb,
      or for an ornament, as near one of the ends is a circular
      crease, or groove, for tying a thread; it is round, two inches
      and a half in length, one inch in diameter at the centre, and
      half-an-inch at each end. It is composed of small pieces of
      native copper, pounded together; and in the cracks between the
      pieces, are stuck several pieces of silver; one nearly the size
      of a four-penny piece, or half a dime. This copper ornament
      was covered with a coat of green rust, and is considerably
      corroded. A piece of red ochre, or paint, and a piece of
      iron ore, which has the appearance of having been partially
      vitrified, or melted, were also found. The ore is about the
      specific gravity of pure iron.</p>

    <p>“The body of the person here buried, was laid on the surface of
      the earth, with his face upwards, and his feet pointing to the
      north-east, and head to the south-west. From the appearance of
      several pieces of charcoal, and bits of partially burnt fossil
      coal, and the black colour of the earth, it would appear that
      the funeral obsequies had been celebrated by fire; and while
      the ashes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
      were yet hot and smoking, a circle of flat stones
      had been laid around and over the body. The circular covering
      is about eight feet in diameter, and the stones yet look
      black, as if stained by fire and smoke. This circle of stones
      seems to have been the nucleus on which the mound was formed,
      as immediately over them is heaped the common earth of the
      adjacent plain, composed of a clayey sand and coarse gravel.
      This mound must originally have been about ten feet high, and
      thirty feet in diameter at its base. At the time of opening
      it, the height was six feet, and diameter between thirty and
      forty. It has every appearance of being as old as any in the
      neighbourhood, and was, at the first settlement of Marietta,
      covered with large trees, the remains of whose roots were yet
      apparent in digging away the earth. It also seems to have been
      made for this single personage, as the remains of one skeleton
      only were discovered. The bones were much decayed, and many of
      them crumbled to dust on exposure to the air. From the length
      of some of them, it is supposed the person was about six feet
      in height.</p>

    <p>“Nothing unusual was discovered in their form, except that
      those of the skull were uncommonly thick. The situation of
      the mound on high ground, near the margin of the plain, and
      the porous quality of the earth, are admirably calculated
      to preserve any perishable substance from the certain
      decay which would attend it in many other situations. To
      these circumstances, is attributed the tolerable state of
      preservation in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
      which several of the articles above described
      were found, after lying in the earth for several centuries. We
      say <i>centuries</i>, from the fact that trees were found growing
      on those ancient works, whose ages were ascertained to amount
      to between four and five hundred years each, by counting the
      concentric circles in the stumps after the trees were cut down;
      and on the ground, besides them, were other trees in a state of
      decay, that appeared to have fallen from old age.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It should be observed with reference to the statements made in the
    above letter, that the age of the trees, said to have been estimated by
    the early settlers at Marietta, has generally been accepted as being
    correct, and based upon direct and accurate evidence. Consequently it
    would be necessary to admit that the earthworks were raised at some
    period before the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>Passing from the question of this date, as calculated by the annular
    rings counted upon the trees, to the subject of the contents of the
    burial mound which was excavated in the presence of Dr. Hildreth; the
    problem that has chiefly to be solved is the age of the silver-plated
    ornaments. It is difficult to fix the time when these were made, but
    judging from the sketches of them, as published in the account of these
    discoveries, the ornaments appear to have been such as would have been
    placed upon the sword belt and scabbard of a European officer of rank.</p>

  <p>When the inclosures and their ramparts were for the first time surveyed
    and described in the year 1805, it was observed that there were
    parallel passages or protected ways leading from the larger of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> the
    forts down to the river. These appear to correspond with the parallels
    that can still be traced at Newark, and which also lead to the river.
    Those at Marietta were however more remarkable, because, in order to
    obtain the gradual approach which was required, it was necessary,
    apparently, to excavate the river bank in such a manner as to make a
    sunken road. A conveniently sloped communication with the water was
    thus constructed. It is probable that at the river side where the
    protecting embankments terminated, a fleet of canoes was kept ready for
    use or escape.</p>

  <p>The next confluence of rivers below Marietta, occurs at the point
    where the Scioto falls into the Ohio. Near the spot where the town of
    Portsmouth is now situated, are traces of an extensive series of low
    embankments which seem to have been made for temporary entrenchments.
    On the opposite or south bank of the river, there was an inclosure
    constructed in the shape of a square, each of the sides being eight
    hundred feet long; the area inclosed was nearly fifteen acres. The
    embankments were over twelve feet high: and there was no ditch.</p>

  <p>This fort was brought into especial notice in consequence of a strange
    discovery. A large number of iron pickaxes, shovels and gunbarrels were
    found buried in the ramparts. It has been conjectured that they were
    hidden there by the French soldiers when they retreated down the Ohio
    after the capture of Fort Du Quesne<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> by the British forces in the
    year <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
    1758. The Indian fortifications on the banks of that river were
    placed upon the direct line of the communication with the other French
    forts in the valley of the Mississippi and Louisiana. In the ordinary
    course of events they would probably have been used by the French and
    their Indian allies, when they happened to be in their neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>The valley of the river Scioto above Portsmouth, towards Chillicothe,
    was evidently much frequented by the Indians, who dwelt in inclosures
    resembling in their formation the square and circular works at
    Newark, although the embankments were of smaller dimensions. A brief
    description of one of them as it existed when first surveyed, is
    sufficient to give a knowledge of the usual plans of these encampments.
    It was situated on the left bank of a tributary of the Scioto, called
    Paint Creek.</p>

  <p>There was a square inclosure, each of whose sides was one thousand and
    eighty feet in length. Attached to this square, which contained an area
    of twenty-seven acres, was a large circular inclosure having a diameter
    of about seventeen hundred feet. This circle had another smaller work
    connected with it which was also circular, and had a diameter of eight
    hundred feet. The embankments of all these inclosures were low, and did
    not anywhere <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
    exceed five feet in height. The position of the gateways
    and the mounds protecting them was the same as in the octagonal work
    at Newark. The large circle had an opening into it leading out of the
    square, and the small circle had also one opening which connected it
    with the other.</p>

  <p>This part of Ohio was, in the eighteenth century, occupied by
    settlements of the Shawnee tribes. In several of the burial mounds,
    which are supposed to have belonged to them, there have been found
    copper kettles, silver crosses and iron gunbarrels—all of which must
    have been unquestionably made by workmen of European descent.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Before</span> quitting the subject of those ancient earthworks, which were
    planned upon geometrical figures, it is necessary to take into
    consideration certain inclosures that were situated in the higher parts
    of the Scioto Valley, in a position which is at the present time,
    occupied by the town of Circleville.</p>

  <p>The embankments or ramparts have been razed to the ground, and no
    traces remain of what appears to have been one of the most perfect
    examples of the mathematical accuracy of that type of construction. It
    is fortunate that during the demolition of the works, there happened
    to be present an antiquarian of such an acknowledged reputation as
    Mr. Atwater, for he has written a full account of their form and
    dimensions,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> together with a report upon the strange
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>discoveries
    made when excavating a burial mound, inside the circular inclosure near
    its centre. Mr. Atwater, who evidently took careful measurements,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
    wrote a statement which includes the following extracts:-</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>“There are two forts, one being an exact circle, the other an
    exact square. The former is surrounded by two walls, with a
    deep ditch between them. The latter is encompassed by one wall,
    without any ditch. The former was sixty-nine rods in diameter,
    measuring from outside to outside of the circular outer wall;
    the latter is exactly fifty-five rods square measuring the
    same way. The walls of the circular fort were at least twenty
    feet in height, measuring from the bottom of the ditch, before
    the town of Circleville was built. The inner wall was of clay,
    taken up probably in the northern part of the fort, where was a
    low place, and is still considerably lower than any other part
    of the work. The outside wall was taken from the ditch which
    is between these walls, and is alluvial, consisting of pebbles
    worn smooth in water, and sand, to a very considerable depth,
    more than fifty feet at least. The outside of the walls is
    about five or six feet in height now; on the inside, the ditch
    is, at present, generally not more than fifteen feet. They are
    disappearing before us daily, and will soon be gone. The walls
    of the square fort are at this time, where left standing, about
    ten feet in height. There were eight gateways or openings
    leading into the square fort, and only one into the circular
    fort. Before each of these openings was a mound of earth,
    perhaps four feet high, forty feet perhaps in diameter at the
    base, and twenty or upwards at the summit. These mounds, for
    two rods or more, are exactly in front of the gateways, and
    were intended for the defence of these openings.” ...</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Inclosures at Circleville.</span><br />
      <span class="small">Reduced from the survey of Mr. Atwater.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
    “The extreme care of the authors of these works to protect and
    defend every part of the circle, is nowhere visible about this
    square fort. The former is defended by two high walls, the
    latter by one. The former has a deep ditch encircling it, this
    has none. The former could be entered at one place only; this
    at eight, and those about twenty feet broad.” ... “The round
    fort was picketed in, if we are to judge from the appearance of
    the ground on and about the walls. Half-way up the outside of
    the inner wall, is a place distinctly to be seen, where a row
    of <em>pickets</em> once stood, and where it was placed when this work
    of defence was originally erected.” ...</p>

  <p>“What surprised me on measuring these forts, was the exact
    manner in which they had laid down their circle and square;
    so that after every effort, by the most careful survey, to
    detect some error in their measurement, we found that it was
    impossible, and that the measurement was much more correct
    than it would have been, in all probability, had the present
    inhabitants undertaken to construct such a work.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="noindent">The mound that had been raised within the circle
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> was ten feet high.
    Its summit had been levelled in order to obtain a platform which had a
    diameter of nearly thirty feet, and had probably been used as a site
    for the dwelling of the chief of the tribe. Mr. Atwater watched the
    proceedings when this mound was destroyed. He states that it contained:—</p>

  <ol>
    <li>“Two human skeletons lying on what had been the original
      surface of the earth.</li>

    <li>“A great quantity of arrow heads, some of which were so
      large as to induce a belief that they were used for spear heads.</li>

    <li>“The handle either of a small sword or a large knife,
      made of an elk’s horn; around the end where the blade had been
      inserted, was a ferule of silver which, though black, was not
      much injured by time. Though the handle showed the hole where
      the blade had been inserted, yet no iron was found, but an
      oxyde remained of similar shape and size.</li>

    <li>“Charcoal and wood ashes on which these articles lay,
      which were surrounded by several bricks very well burnt. The
      skeleton appeared to have been burned in a large and very hot
      fire, which had almost consumed the bones of the deceased.
      This skeleton was deposited a little to the south of the
      centre of the tumulus, and, about twenty feet to the north of
      it was another, with which were—</li>

    <li>“A large mirror, about three feet in length, and one foot
      and a half in breadth, and one inch and a half in thickness.
      This mirror was of isinglass (mica membranacea) and on it—</li>

    <li><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>“A
      plate of iron which had become an oxyde; but before it
      was disturbed by the spade, resembled a plate of cast iron.
      The mirror answered the purpose very well for which it was
      intended. This skeleton had also been burned like the former,
      and lay on charcoal and a considerable quantity of wood ashes.
      A part of the mirror is in my possession as well as a piece of
      brick, taken from the spot at the time.”</li>
  </ol>

  <p>About two hundred yards from this tumulus, and outside the circular
    inclosure was a large mound, supposed to have been the common Indian
    cemetery. It contained an immense number of human skeletons of all
    sizes and ages. The skeletons are laid horizontally, with their heads
    generally towards the centre, and the feet towards the outside of the
    tumulus. A considerable part of this work still stands uninjured,
    except by time. In it have been found, besides these skeletons, stone
    axes and knives, and several ornaments with holes through them, by
    means of which, with a cord passing through these perforations, they
    could be worn by their owners.</p>

  <p>The vestiges of occupation that have been left by those ancient tribes
    who raised the earthworks in this region are not of a character that
    render it possible to form any absolute conclusions about them.</p>

  <p>There are, however, in Ohio two large and important mounds built in the
    shape of animals which may, possibly, have been made for the purpose
    of indicating the emblems which were adopted by the Indians as their
    totems. One of these is placed on the summit of a hill overlooking the
    valley of one of the tributaries of the Licking river, and about three
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
    miles from the octagonal inclosure near Newark.</p>

  <p>In consequence of its shape, it is called the Alligator. There have
    been various theories with regard to this strange earthwork, and it has
    been supposed that sacrificial ceremonies were performed there. I had
    expected to find this figure to a certain extent excavated upon the
    surface of the earth, but I observed, upon examining it, that it was a
    regularly built up mound of considerable size.</p>

  <p>The other large totem, which represents a huge serpent, is upon the
    brow of a hill about one hundred miles to the South-west of the
    Alligator, above a small river called the Brush Creek. According to the
    measurements of the earliest surveyors, its length, if extended, is
    about one thousand feet. It was five feet high in the centre, and had,
    at that part, a base of thirty feet, which diminished towards the head
    and tail.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

  <p>Upon the slopes of the hills near the Alligator, there are numerous
    remains of ancient earthworks. One of the most extensive of them was in
    every respect different from those at Newark, and other geometrically
    designed works, and seems to have been raised for other purposes, or
    possibly by a different tribe. Its embankments, which are irregular in
    their form, are in no part higher than six
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>feet, and are thrown up in
    such a manner as to inclose the top of a small hill, which is situated
    a short distance from the Alligator. The area contained within them is
    about eighteen acres. In the centre there is a small circular earthwork
    nearly one hundred yards in circumference, and in another part of the
    inclosure there are two mounds which have been opened. They contained
    large quantities of ashes and some broken pottery.</p>

  <p>There are also other camping grounds near the river. The largest of
    them inclosed a space exceeding twenty acres, and was surrounded
    by a low bank evidently thrown up for the purposes of inclosing a
    temporary encampment. Near the Alligator totem I noticed a singular
    earthwork made in the shape of a half-moon. The farmers living in the
    neighbourhood told me that they had opened and destroyed many of the
    small mounds that had been upon their lands. In all cases they had
    contained nothing but fragments of rough pottery, together with small
    heaps of ashes.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

  <p>Finally, there remains to be taken into consideration those great
    earthworks on the hills which have been specially classified as having
    been undoubtedly raised <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
    for the purposes of defence, and which
    entirely differ from such works as those that were placed upon the
    plains. The largest of these camps has been called Fort Ancient, and
    it must be acknowledged to be one of the most important fortified
    entrenchments that has ever been constructed in any part of the world.</p>

  <p>It is placed upon the summit of a hill overlooking the Little Miami
    river about thirty miles above its junction with the Ohio. The site
    that was chosen by the Indians is remarkable for its natural strength
    and is, upon three sides of it, almost impregnable. The hill which is
    about two hundred and thirty feet above the valley, is in the form of
    a narrow promontory having almost precipitous sides except where it is
    joined to the plateau. The Little Miami winds round one part of the
    base, and some small tributary streams join it from the other side.</p>

  <p>The shape and length of the embankments are shown in the accompanying
    plan, which is a reduction that I have drawn from one that was made
    in 1843 by Professor Locke of Cincinnati.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It will be observed
    that the ramparts follow closely the curves of the ridge of the hill
    and that the camp is practically divided into two parts, the outer
    division being near the plain, and the inner one being at the head of
    the promontory, where the sides of the hill are the most steep and
    inaccessible. The latter was probably intended as a final stronghold in
    the event of the outer work being captured.</p>

  <p>The magnitude of the inclosing embankments of the outer camp is
    astonishing. It is here that the position is most open to direct
    attack, and no efforts or labour have been spared in carrying out
    what was thought necessary to prevent capture. No Roman or British
    encampment that I have seen surpasses this great Indian work. I walked
    round the entire circuit of the ramparts. They are not less than four
    miles in length. They follow every curve of the hill and the heads of
    all the numerous ravines.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
    <a id="i_088"><img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption"><i>Fort Ancient</i></div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

  <p>The ground of the inclosure is level. At the time of my visit it was
    covered with forest trees, amongst which were many poplars. Upon the
    slopes of the embankments there was a luxuriant growth of large beeches
    and oaks. The quantity of earth that must have been conveyed and thrown
    up when forming these banks must have been enormous. The ramparts
    vary in height between ten and twenty feet according to the character
    of the natural defence afforded by the slopes of the hill. At the
    approach from the plain they are fifteen feet high and have a base of
    sixty-three feet. The platform at the top averages five feet wide.</p>

  <p>There is no ditch. Nothing could more clearly mark the difference
    between this fortification and one that would have been made by a white
    race. An outer ditch is usually considered as not only of essential
    importance in works of defence, but its excavation supplies the earth
    required for the ramparts. It seems evident that either these Indians
    in their method of defensive warfare did not always consider a ditch to
    be useful, or it is possible that, in consequence of not having shovels
    or pickaxes, they preferred obtaining earth in some other manner which
    they found more convenient.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

  <p>Upon inquiring among the farmers who were occupying the adjacent land,
    I found that there was a prevalent opinion amongst them that the earth
    composing these embankments had been brought from a distance and that
    it had been carried by hand. It was also believed by them that the fort
    could not have been made by Indians and that it was built at a very
    remote period by some other race.</p>

  <p>When walking upon the top of the broad ramparts I observed that there
    were no evidences of the excavations that supplied the earth for the
    formation of the enormous banks. In some parts of the interior there
    were some shallow depressions, and also several holes which had been
    made for some unknown purpose, but they could not have provided the
    quantities required. It is possible, and, I think probable, that the
    earth was taken from the surface of the land within the inclosure. A
    shallow excavation made to a depth not exceeding six inches over the
    whole area of one hundred and forty acres would have given a sufficient
    supply. The methods of digging the ground, and of conveying the earth
    must necessarily have been very primitive, and it is surprising that,
    with all the difficulties that had to be overcome, works of such
    magnitude should have been raised.</p>

  <p>At a gap in an angle over-looking the river the remains of a road,
    which led down to the water, can still be traced. At the part where
    this road entered the fort it is evident that it had been paved
    with flat water-worn stones. The ramparts here reach their greatest
    dimensions, being fully twenty feet high. The appearance of Fort
    Ancient from this position was very remarkable, and the effect was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
    heightened by the beautiful foliage of the forest trees that crowned
    the summits of these lofty earthworks.</p>

  <p>The inner part of the camp was strongly fortified. High banks were
    raised across the narrow part of the enclosure at the centre, and
    two mounds guarded the approach. The road to the outer camp from the
    plain was also protected by two mounds, and from these there ran low
    parallels for a distance of nearly fourteen hundred yards. They then
    terminated by closing round another mound which was probably used for
    the purpose of a look-out. Some labourers at a farm near this position
    told me that there once existed other parallel banks connected with the
    fort, which could be traced for several miles, but that these had been
    destroyed.</p>

  <p>There are certain features in the construction of this fortification
    which have attracted attention, but their purpose has not been, and
    probably cannot be, explained. There are not less than seventy gaps
    or openings leading out of the embankments. It has been supposed that
    these were intended to allow the escape of water from the interior.
    There is another theory which has been suggested, according to which
    it is thought possible that they were openings made with the object
    of enabling the Indians to rush out at several points to repel their
    enemies, and that they were fenced by stockades.</p>

  <p>It, however, happens that these gaps are sometimes in positions where
    the slopes of the hill are so steep as to be practically inaccessible,
    and at other places they are on the level ground from which no surplus
    waters could drain away. They seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
    have formed part of the system
    of fortification, for they occur in the same inexplicable manner at
    another hill work of defence, built under similar conditions, on the
    summit of a promontory with precipitous slopes, about forty miles to
    the south-east of this position, which was evidently built by the same
    race.</p>

  <p>This large earthwork is called Fort Hill, and it is singular in the
    respect of having afforded to its surveyor the means of forming a
    judgment upon the question of its antiquity. Consequently it has become
    possible to establish well-founded conclusions with respect to the
    dates of the construction of earthworks of a similar character.</p>

  <p>Professor Locke, in his report on the geology of that part of Ohio,
    stated that on the top of the wall of Fort Hill stood a chestnut tree
    six feet in diameter. “Counting and measuring,” he observes, “the
    annual layers of wood where an axeman had cut into the trunk, I found
    them at nearly 200 to the foot, which would give to this tree the age
    of 600 years. A poplar tree, seven feet in diameter, standing in the
    ditch, allowing the thickness to the layers which I have found in
    like poplars, 170 to the foot, would give nearly the same result, 607
    years.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

  <p>Accepting the deductions of Professor Locke as being correct, it
    follows that the period when this hill fort was constructed was not
    later than the thirteenth century. Admitting that the thirteenth
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
    century, is therefore the latest age that can be ascribed to works
    of this type, they may be much older, for the forest trees within the
    inclosures may have succeeded earlier growths.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to form an estimate of the age of earthworks from
    their appearance,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and it is only by counting the annual rings
    of trees that happen to have been growing upon them, that any safe
    theories respecting their antiquity can be adopted.</p>

  <p>Looking at the geographical position of Fort Ancient, with reference
    to the other hill works of defence that are supposed to have been
    made by the Mound Builders, there are good reasons for assuming that
    this was their last stronghold, built with the intention of creating
    a permanent barrier against the attacks of their enemies. In time
    of war it was a secure encampment, large enough to contain the men,
    women and children of a numerous tribe. In time of peace it was well
    situated for the usual requirements of Indians. It was in the midst
    of a country abounding with game, and was immediately connected with
    a good navigable river which enabled their canoes to maintain direct
    communications with the Ohio and Mississippi.</p>

  <p>Although, as far as I was able to judge, there was nothing in the
    principles of construction of the hill defensive works which appeared
    to be beyond the capacities of a purely Indian race, I invariably
    found <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
    that the men who were settled as farmers near the principal
    entrenchments held the opinion that they must have been raised by a
    people possessing a superior condition of civilisation to the tribes
    who occupied the land at the close of the eighteenth century, and who
    were personally known by many of the early settlers.</p>

  <p>It is, perhaps, desirable that these local opinions should not be
    altogether disregarded, especially when it is remembered that they are
    supported to some extent by Indian traditions and by the fact that no
    embankments of a similar formation exist in any other part of North
    America. It is therefore necessary that the statements of the Indians,
    respecting the previous occupation of parts of Ohio and Kentucky by men
    of a white race, should be given a passing consideration.</p>

  <p>The Shawnees, who were found to be in possession of this region,
    informed the European colonists that the ancient forts had been made
    by white people, who after long wars against the Indians had been
    exterminated. Their traditions upon this subject were said to have been
    clear and decided.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the statements of the Delawares, who were settled in
    the Northern parts of the State point to other conclusions. They said
    that the men who had raised the forts and entrenchments were called
    the Tallegewi, and that great wars took place between them and the
    Iroquois. After many years the Tallegewi were defeated and left the
    country. The Delawares made no allusion with respect to any differences
    of race or colour between the Tallegewi and the other Indian tribes.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

  <p>It is much to be regretted that the evidence upon this interesting
    subject is so vague and obscure. If men of foreign origin had been
    settled in Ohio before the fourteenth century it would be reasonable
    to expect that traces of them would have been left there or some
    remaining indications of their religion. In the reports and letters of
    the French missionaries, many of whom spoke and understood the language
    of the tribes amongst whom they lived, there is no mention made of any
    rumours or traditions of white people having dwelt in this part of
    America. There were however at a later period, about the middle of the
    eighteenth century, certain statements made by officers and men who had
    been made prisoners by the Indians, which, at that time, received much
    attention. A cavalry officer, named Stuart, said that in the country
    west of Mississippi he had seen a tribe of Indians who were remarkably
    white in colour and had reddish hair. He was informed by them that
    their forefathers came from a foreign land and had settled in Florida,
    but that when the Spaniards invaded that country they moved to their
    present dwelling places. A fellow-captive, who was a Welshman, declared
    that he understood the language of the tribe, as it differed very
    little from what was spoken in Wales.</p>

  <p>Other reports of a similar character were made by men who had lived
    with tribes occupying lands near the southern parts of the Mississippi
    valley. It has also been noticed that Indians having fair hair and
    blue eyes, were living with the Mandans in their settlements near the
    Missouri. With respect to the statements about Welsh speaking Indians,
    it is possible <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
    that the captives may have been influenced by the
    belief in the truth of the tradition that ships, under the direction
    of Prince Madoc, left the Welsh coasts in the twelfth century and
    landed their crews and emigrants on the eastern shores of the Florida
    peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

  <p>It is not, however, necessary to account for the existence of large
    but irregular embankments, such as those at Fort Ancient, by the
    supposition that the actions of a numerous tribe of Indians were under
    the influence or direction of men belonging to another race. But it is
    otherwise with reference to the geometrical inclosures on the plains,
    for these must have been unquestionally planned by men who possessed a
    competent knowledge of the methods of tracing mathematical designs.</p>

  <p>Take for example the plans of the works at Newark and Circleville.
    It may be thought that simple figures, such as the squares, would be
    within the comprehension of uneducated Indians. It would nevertheless
    be found difficult to lay down upon open fields a square, with all the
    sides equal and its angles true right angles, containing so large an
    area as twenty acres.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>

    <div class="caption smcap">Octagonal and Circular Inclosures<br />
      <span class="small">near newark</span>.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

  <p>The execution of the outlines of correct circles inclosing spaces of
    nearly thirty acres, presents still greater difficulties. It would
    have required a specially trained mind to form the conception of a
    circumference having an imaginary point within, from which all lines
    drawn to it would be equal.</p>

  <p>But the figure which would have been absolutely impracticable to
    construct without proper surveying appliances for making accurate
    measurements, and fixing the true angles, is that of the octagon. Even
    under the most favourable circumstances, with the help of suitable
    instruments, it would have required much skill and calculation to
    trace a true octagon <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
    whose embankments contained within them an area
    exceeding forty acres. It is difficult to suppose that an accurately
    designed work of this shape and magnitude could have been planned by
    Indians, or that the construction of a figure so essentially scientific
    and unusual, could have been originated by them. It is therefore
    possible to conclude, that, the geometrical earthworks in Ohio may have
    been raised by native tribes, acting under the direction of European
    surveyors, or of men who had received a mathematical education.</p>

  <p>Considerations upon the subject of the race and capacity of the
    builders, have been to some extent complicated by the reports that were
    made concerning the ages of the trees that grew upon and within the
    ancient ramparts at Marietta. In the letter of Dr. Hildreth, quoted
    in the previous chapter, it is clearly stated that trees were growing
    there which were from four to five hundred years old.</p>

  <p>As this evidence is very important it is desirable to examine it with
    attention. This statement was made when he was attempting to fix an
    approximate date for the age of a burial mound which was placed near
    the fortifications. It was at the bottom of this mound that were
    discovered the ornaments of a sword belt and scabbard. These ornaments
    were made of copper and plated with silver, and must therefore have
    been of European manufacture.</p>

  <p>The calculation of the age of the trees is probably based upon the
    results of an examination that took place shortly after the settlement
    of Marietta during the latter part of the eighteenth century. It was
    at that time decided by several of the inhabitants to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> fell some of
    the largest and oldest trees then growing within the earthworks, and
    ascertain their ages by counting the number of annual rings contained
    in them. The operations were executed in the presence of Governor St.
    Clair and the Rev. Dr. Cutler. Several of the trees were found to have
    between three hundred and four hundred circles. One tree was carefully
    examined and Dr. Cutler stated that it contained at least four hundred
    and sixty-three circles.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

  <p>As nothing can be more conclusive as a proof of age than the number
    of rings found in any tree growing beyond the tropics, this evidence
    establishes an antiquity for these embankments earlier than the middle
    of the fourteenth century.</p>

  <p>The ages of the trees growing upon the Marietta inclosures do not
    however enable a date to be estimated for the construction of such
    works as those at Newark, for the shapes at Marietta are irregular
    and, according to the survey, do not appear to have been laid down
    with geometrical accuracy. It is therefore probable that the Newark
    inclosures were made at some later period.</p>

  <p>The fact of a ferule of silver and a plate of iron having been placed
    with the skeletons in the burial mound at Circleville leads to the
    conclusion that the tumulus like the one at Marietta was raised since
    the time of the arrival of the Europeans. On account of its having been
    placed within the inclosure it was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>originally conjectured that it
    belonged to the same people that formed the surrounding embankment, but
    the evidence is not sufficient to establish the correctness of a theory
    of such importance.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to understand what could have been the object of the
    Indians in constructing large earthworks in the shapes of squares and
    circles. Various theories have been advanced upon the subject, but
    nothing that can be considered satisfactory has yet been ascertained.
    Upon an examination of the plans it naturally occurs to the mind
    to endeavour to form an opinion as to the reasons which led to the
    adoption of these particular forms.</p>

  <p>It is probable that these types of inclosures would be convenient for
    the habits and purposes of an Indian tribe during peace, and that
    they afforded protection in war. The square inclosures may have been
    intended to contain the village, the dwellings of the chiefs, and the
    council house. The circles, with their single opening for approach,
    which could be strongly guarded, would in that case be the strongholds
    in which, during hostilities, would be placed the women and children.
    A circular fort, such as that at Newark, would, under the usual
    conditions of Indian warfare, be practically impregnable. In the event
    of the outer square being captured it would have a sufficient area to
    give the space that would be wanted for the defending tribe.</p>

  <p>The antiquity of these works is a problem that does not possess all
    the elements that are required for its solution. But in consequence
    of the exceptional system of construction certain inferences can be
    determined. It may be assumed that the geometrically
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>shaped inclosures
    could not have been planned by Indians, and that therefore the
    square, circular and octagonal works, were constructed at some period
    subsequent to the landing of the Spaniards in Florida, in the beginning
    of the sixteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

  <p>If these embankments were raised before that period, it would be
    almost necessary to admit, that white men possessing a knowledge of
    mathematics were living amongst the Indians before the discovery of
    America by Columbus in 1492.</p>

  <p>The difficult and interesting questions relating to the origin,
    civilisation and fate of the Mound Builders, have been the subjects of
    frequent investigations and of numerous theories. They appear to have
    inhabited Ohio for many centuries.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the conclusion of a navigation of the waters of the Ohio, which
    had extended over a distance exceeding nine hundred miles, we arrived
    at the mouth of that river, and proceeded on our course up the
    Mississippi. Evening was approaching when we saw a large steamer called
    the Stonewall, passing us on her way to New Orleans, crowded with
    passengers happily unaware of the terrible nature of their impending
    fate, and of the event about to happen before nightfall.</p>

  <p>At sunset, all those who were on board of our vessel, were assembled
    upon the upper deck, watching the unusual brilliancy of the reflections
    upon the water, and the vivid colouring of the clouds gathering round
    the setting sun. We then supposed these effects to be caused by the
    haze sometimes observed in the atmosphere during that beautiful season
    towards the close of the year, which has been given the name of the
    Indian summer. We were ignorant of the conflagration that was taking
    place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
    lower down the river, or we might have surmised that the glowing
    tints were possibly caused by the smoke and flames rising from the
    burning of the steamer we had seen earlier in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>We were afterwards informed that news had been received, that a
    disastrous fire had occurred on board the Stonewall shortly after we
    passed her, and the flames spread with such rapidity, that, although
    she was close to the river banks, only thirty-five out of two hundred
    and forty passengers were saved. The accident was caused by the
    carelessness of a man, who, when lighting his pipe, accidentally set
    fire to a quantity of hay that was carried between the upper decks as
    cargo. It was usual to protect the hay when embarked in this manner,
    by covering it with a tarpaulin, but through some inattention this
    precaution had been neglected. The Stonewall was burnt to the water’s
    edge.</p>

  <p>As we drew near to St. Louis, we passed the wide low plains upon which
    is situated the great Cahokia Mound. As it was my purpose to make an
    expedition to that part of Illinois before proceeding to the upper part
    of the Mississippi Valley, I went there a few days after we had landed
    from the steamer.</p>

  <p>The mound when seen from the plains, stands out from them in a manner
    so isolated and prominent, that it seems at the first glance, to be
    unquestionable that it must have been raised by human labour; but upon
    a closer investigation there are good reasons for believing it to be
    a natural formation of the land, shaped originally like a rounded
    hillock, and subsequently terraced and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
    altered in such a manner as to
    make it appear to be altogether artificial. It is ninety feet high, and
    the base, if the whole of the irregular and spreading area is included,
    covers a space of about nine acres. The summit is level, and contains
    nearly two acres. Upon this was established a substantial farmhouse,
    which I found to be tenanted by a kind and hospitable family, who were
    evidently in a prosperous condition, and able to cultivate their land
    advantageously.</p>

  <p>The hillock has been given locally the name of Monks Mound, in
    consequence of its having been for several years the site of a small
    monastery, belonging to some of the brethren of La Trappe, who, towards
    the close of the last century, emigrated to this remote spot when the
    monastic orders were suppressed during the French Revolution. The
    monks used the lower slopes as a garden, and there still remain the
    indications of the terraced ground which was used by them for their
    solitary walks. The Trappists are supposed to have left Cahokia at the
    time of the restoration of the Bourbons. Probably they returned to
    France when the Monastery of La Trappe was re-established, in the reign
    of Louis XVIII.</p>

  <p>Before the mound was used as a farm there was on its summit an Indian
    tumulus. The farmer <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
    taking a practical view of this burial heap,
    destroyed it and spread the contents over his land.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />
  <blockquote>
    <p>The accompanying sketch of the mounds was taken from the slope
      of the Cahokia Mound, at a height of about forty feet above
      the plain. It represents what now remains of these singular
      earthworks; they must originally have been much more numerous.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>On the plain below, there exists a remarkable group of circular and
    platform mounds, which, in consequence of their unusual position and
    ground plan, demand careful attention. They differ from the earthworks
    in Ohio, and appear to have been raised by a tribe having exceptional
    customs and habits of life. The mounds are not surrounded by any
    embankments, and were entirely unprotected. They were probably raised
    to make high platforms for the dwellings of the chiefs. One of them was
    used, at the time of my visit to Cahokia, as the site of the village
    schoolhouse.</p>

  <p>I endeavoured to trace the plan of the ancient inclosure, which
    contained a group of the greatest archæological importance, but so
    many of the mounds had been levelled, that it was difficult to form
    definite conclusions with regard to its shape or extent. It seems to
    have been an irregular parallelogram, about fifteen hundred yards in
    length, having at each end a large earthwork or mound, with a wide
    and well levelled platform on the top. In the centre, there were two
    conical mounds, which must have been raised in that position for some
    important purpose. They were each about forty feet high, and appeared
    to have been so placed as to dominate the mounds forming the sides of
    the inclosure. The men farming the adjacent plains, stated that there
    had been a large number of small burial mounds on their lands, most of
    which had been destroyed. They had found in them quantities of bones
    and skulls, but no ornaments or stone weapons.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

  <p>When ploughing the ground, they had seen below the surface, fragments
    of rude pottery and many flint arrow heads. A large and highly polished
    stone spear head was discovered near the settlement and given by the
    finder to the young American lady who was then acting as teacher at the
    school house on the mound. It was a hard kind of flinty chert, and was
    a singularly fine specimen of Indian workmanship.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

  <p>When I had completed the measurement of the spaces inclosed by the
    mounds on the plain, I returned to the great mound in order to examine
    it, and my previous conjecture that it was a natural formation remained
    unchanged. It was, however, impossible to form a decided opinion
    upon the subject, for it required a properly executed scientific
    investigation to be made, before the problem of the construction could
    be determined. If it should be proved to be artificial, its position
    and shape as a high platform earthwork, would support a theory, that it
    was raised by the same race that built the greater temple platform of
    Cholula, in Mexico.</p>

  <p>After quitting the Cahokia mounds and traversing several miles of the
    plains, where for centuries many generations of Indians had encamped,
    I returned to St. Louis and embarked on board the Muscatine, a steamer
    about to proceed to the highest part of the navigable waters of the
    Mississippi. Sixteen miles above St. Louis we passed the mouth of the
    Missouri, and observed how its waters, thickly charged with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> earth,
    entirely changed the character of the river into which it flowed. Above
    the confluence, the Mississippi is a clear, tranquil stream, but after
    receiving the Missouri it becomes muddy, rushing, and turbulent.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Indian Mounds, Cahokia.</div>
  </div>

  <p>It had been my intention to have gone up the Missouri to Nebraska, and
    the ancient hunting grounds of the Pawnees, but there were certain
    difficulties which made that plan impracticable, so I decided to
    proceed northwards, and then to cross the prairies of Minnesota, and
    Iowa towards the valley of the river Platte. I was fortunate in having
    as a companion on board the steamer, an American judge, who, before
    being appointed to the post he then held, had been for many years
    acting as Indian agent to the Sacs and Foxes, and was well acquainted
    with the habits of the tribes, who were at that time dwelling upon the
    territories bordering on the banks of the river.</p>

  <p>Judge Williams had great sympathy for the condition of the tribes with
    whom he lived, and he endeavoured to ascertain if it were possible
    to establish a higher state of civilisation amongst them. He thought
    that the younger members of the Sacs and Foxes might be educated in
    such a manner, that with due attention to the nature of the Indian
    temperament, they could be made capable of taking
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>a sensible part
    in the conduct of affairs, and become fitted to fulfil the duties or
    occupations of useful and peaceful citizens. The authorities with
    whom he consulted, agreed with him as to the utility of the scheme
    suggested. Suitable school buildings were placed upon the reservation,
    and good teachers were selected. For a time the work progressed
    favourably; the boys were in the first place well grounded in the
    English language, and then their attention was directed to mathematics.</p>

  <p>After several years of study, the senior class of boys had become so
    far advanced, as to be able to draw geometrical figures and understand
    elementary algebra. The teachers were hopeful, and it was thought
    probable, that some of the pupils might ultimately make such progress
    as to enable them to be prepared for Yale University. All the zeal and
    energies of the masters, were however proved to have been useless.
    One morning the whole of the senior class appeared at school, dressed
    and painted for war. They had thrown off their ordinary clothes, had
    put on mocassins and leggings, twisted their hair in accordance with
    savage customs and had stuck feathers in it. The principal asked them
    what was meant by this extraordinary conduct. “We have come to say,”
    they replied, “that we now leave you; we are no longer boys: we are
    Indians.” They then, without saying another word, abruptly left the
    school and never returned to it.</p>

  <p>The experiences of Judge Williams, with respect to the subject of the
    higher education of those tribes of North American Indians, whose
    territories were in the upper part of the valley of the Mississippi,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
    corresponded with what I was told by the French Missionaries placed in
    charge of the Indian convents in the valley of the St. Lawrence. More
    than two centuries had elapsed since the work of converting, educating
    and civilising the Iroquois, Chippewa and Algonquin tribes was
    undertaken. During that long time there had been no good result. The
    earnest labours and devotion of their lives to these duties had been
    unavailing, and the attempts to overcome the wild instincts of Indians
    were thoroughly unsuccessful. The Judge was of opinion, that, with all
    Indians, the desire for a free and savage life, became irrepressible
    upon reaching manhood.</p>

  <p>On the plains near the river, there were numerous vestiges of native
    encampments. At Nauvoo, I was told by a farmer that he opened a great
    number of low mounds which were on his land, and had found in them
    nothing but broken pottery and charcoal, but in ploughing his fields
    he had discovered quantities of arrow heads, and several grooved stone
    hammers.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Higher up the Mississippi we entered the country once
    occupied by the Dakotas, who in the seventeenth century were considered
    to be a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
    most brave and powerful tribe, having superstitious customs
    and tribal regulations of an unusual nature.</p>

  <p>One of their minor methods of warfare was noticed by the early
    explorers on the prairies through which we were passing. It was the
    custom with wandering bands of this race, if surprised by a larger body
    of enemies and thus unable to make an open resistance, to dig wide,
    shallow pits, in which they placed the women and children, and obtained
    a certain amount of protection for themselves. These excavations were
    scooped out with great rapidity, the men and their families using
    for this purpose knives, tomahawks and wooden ladles. This method of
    digging the ground, may probably have been similar to that adopted by
    the Mound Builders in raising their ramparts. War pits were also made
    by the Hurons when retreating from the Iroquois. When coasting the
    north shore of Lake Superior, I was shown on the map the positions
    where several of these places of refuge and defence had been observed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

  <p>We saw at night upon the bluffs, the fires of Indian camps; it was
    thought probable that these Indians, whose villages were situated far
    towards the West, had come to this part of their ancient territory, for
    the purpose of performing certain forms of worship before one of the
    large detached granite boulders, situated on the plateau near to their
    tents. On the following evening, as we steamed slowly through Lake
    Pepin, we looked with much interest at the high steep promontory, upon
    whose summit the love-distracted maiden Winona<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> sang her death song,
    and then leapt from the edge of the cliff and was dashed to pieces on
    the rocks below, within sight of her tribe who were assembled near
    their tents on the shore.</p>

  <p>The Muscatine terminated her long upward voyage against the swift
    stream, at the city of St. Paul’s, nineteen hundred and forty-four
    miles above the mouth of the river, a few miles below the great falls
    of St. Anthony, and near the confluence of the Minnesota. All this
    region was at one time, the principal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
    gathering place of the branch of
    the Dakotas, called Sioux, and near at hand was the cave where their
    annual council meetings took place. To this place were also brought for
    burial, the bones and skulls of their dead, whose bodies had previously
    been placed upon scaffolds, and exposed to the influences of the winds
    and weather.</p>

  <p>Upon a bluff overlooking the Mississippi, there are still to be seen a
    strange group of large mounds, whose purpose has not been ascertained.
    The examination of them has failed to afford the slightest clue by
    which any theory or conjecture can be safely established. Soon after my
    arrival I went there to examine them with particular attention, for I
    had observed certain peculiarities in their shape and position, which
    resembled portions of the defensive hill works of the Mound Builders.
    Mr. Hill, a member of the Historical Society of St. Paul’s, accompanied
    me, and pointed out those mounds which had been opened, and carefully
    inspected by competent observers. It has been supposed that they were
    the burial places of the Sioux during long periods of time, and it was
    hoped that some discoveries would be made of antiquarian importance.</p>

  <p>The largest of the mounds was first examined, but nothing was found
    in it. There were no signs of burials near the slopes, and at the
    base, contrary to expectation, there was not found any indication of a
    fire having been made, and there was no charcoal. In another conical
    mound, although no bones were seen, there was in the centre a hollow
    space which contained several pieces of charred wood. A comparatively
    low platform mound was then opened. Two
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> skeletons were found buried
    near the surface, but from their position and state of preservation,
    they were considered to be late interments; nothing else was found
    within. Finally a large mound, situated upon the extreme edge of the
    bluff, was thoroughly excavated, and in this there was found, as in
    the previously opened conical earthwork, a small hollow space in the
    centre. In consequence of these negative results, it was not possible
    to form any conclusions as to the object of Indians in raising these
    exceptional works. I thought it not improbable that it might have been
    their intention to use them, either for raised dwelling places, or for
    defensive inclosures which had not been completed.</p>

  <p>Their position is almost impregnable; the mounds are not placed
    separately but are closely joined together, so that they form a kind
    of embankment. The outer slopes are so close to the edge of the cliff,
    that they are practically a prolongation of the steep slopes, and thus
    present a singular parallel with portions of those embankments of Fort
    Ancient which overlook the valley of the Little Miami. The similarity
    in the methods of placing the mounds, is made additionally obvious from
    the fact, that there are numerous springs issuing from the upper parts
    of the bluff, which flow down as rivulets into the river below. There
    are altogether fifteen mounds on the top of the promontory; the largest
    of them is about twenty feet high.</p>

  <p>Upon our return to St. Paul’s, we heard that a band of Sioux had
    come into the neighbourhood, and were encamped amongst the woods on
    the opposite side of the river. As I wished to see these Indians, I
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
    crossed over to the settlement of Mendota, and after a walk of a few
    miles, saw their tents pitched close to the borders of a small lake. I
    was greeted with a loud noise of barking from their dogs, who were as
    numerous outside the camp of the Sioux as they usually are around the
    dwellings of the Kurds in Asia Minor. After overcoming some preliminary
    hostile difficulties with these yelping curs, I received a silent and
    not pressing welcome from the Indians, who were mostly squaws and
    children, the men having gone away temporarily upon some expedition.</p>

  <p>It was getting dark, and the women were making preparations for supper.
    Good fires were burning brightly in the centre of the wigwams, the
    kettles were hung over them, the water was boiling, and the interiors
    were cheerful scenes of enjoyment. The life within and without, was
    similar to what may be seen in an English gipsy encampment in the New
    Forest in Hampshire. There was something singularly attractive in the
    habits of life amongst these wandering nomads, and the warmth and
    comfort inside the tents, was in pleasing contrast to the cold and
    wintry aspect without. This simple and natural state of existence, has
    unquestionably a great charm for those whose natures are essentially
    Bohemian. It is not surprising that Indian lads, accustomed to this
    kind of life, should feel wearied and cramped by the trammels of
    civilization. It is natural that they should long to get away from the
    confinement and irksome training of school, and return to the freedom
    and independence of their savage hunting and wandering instincts.</p>

  <p>There lived at the adjacent town of Mendota, a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>half-bred Indian,
    of French and Sioux parentage named Faribault, with whom I became
    acquainted. In his youth, he had dwelt with his mother in the
    villages of the Sioux, and spoke their language. In manhood, he had
    acted as an agent and trader for the tribes, and passed much of his
    life in constant communication with them, and possessed an intimate
    acquaintance with their superstitions and religious ceremonies. This
    kind of direct personal knowledge, can only be obtained by a man whom
    the Indians consider as being one of themselves, in consequence of
    his having had an Indian mother belonging to their tribe. It was the
    custom of the Sioux, when they encamped in this part of the country, to
    meet at his house, and several of them happened to be there when I was
    present.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Sioux Encampment.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Faribault, like all Indians, was usually very reticent, but when he
    noticed that I took much interest in matters relating to the habits
    of his tribe, especially such as were connected with their religious
    beliefs and customs, he became frank and outspoken. He told me of his
    own various strange personal experiences, and was particularly earnest
    when he mentioned some of the most remarkable of the rules relating to
    their fasts and sacrifices. The Indians, who were usually standing near
    us listening to what he said, would occasionally, from time to time,
    signify their assent to his statements by harsh grunts of approval.</p>

  <p>Amongst the superstitions mentioned by him, none caused more attention
    than those connected with the worship of their Spirit rocks. One of
    these, which has always been considered to be an important
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> Manito,
    happened to be on the plateau above Mendota, and the Indians directed
    me to the spot where it was placed. I found it to be a huge granite
    boulder, which had probably been deposited there by the moving waters
    or icebergs, during that remote period when they were travelling
    southwards from the sub-arctic latitudes. As it had no geological
    relation whatever with the sandstone ground upon which it rested, the
    Sioux might have conjectured, that it had been dropped from the clouds.
    To ignorant savages, unversed in the mysteries and conclusions of
    scientific geology, no other explanation could have been satisfactory.
    It lies upon a level space of land, upon the top of a bluff, commanding
    magnificent views over the valleys of the Mississippi and Minnesota.
    The confluence of these great rivers can be seen, and the steep
    water-worn cliffs below the falls of St. Anthony.</p>

  <p>Whilst standing upon the promontory, and looking at this wide prospect,
    I was joined by a priest, who had been fulfilling his duties at a
    neighbouring settlement. We remained near the Spirit rock,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> looking
    at the solitary mass of granite, glittering in the sunshine, and
    thought that it was not surprising that the Indians believed this
    strange rock to be the manifestation of a great unknown power, and
    should have invested with supernatural attributes what must have seemed
    to them to be marvellous.</p>

  <p>The boulder is polygonal in form, and stands about
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>seven feet high
    above the ground. In the other dimensions, it averages a thickness from
    nine to twelve feet. It is composed chiefly of grey granite, and its
    weight must exceed seventy tons. Faribault said that, when he was a
    young man, wandering bands of Sioux occasionally came to this Spirit
    rock and encamped near it. They usually stopped about a week, but
    sometimes during a whole moon. It was their custom during this period
    to continually offer sacrifices, dance round the stone, and paint it
    with various colours, red, blue or white. Finally, before taking down
    their tents, they covered it with their best furs or skins, and left
    them there as propitiatory offerings.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption smcap">Spirit Rock.<br />
      <span class="small">Confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>The falls of the Mississippi were also worshipped by the Indians,
    through whose territories that great river flowed in its upper course,
    and the manner in which adoration was made to the Power, which was
    manifested in the movements of these cataracts, is well described
    by Captain Carver, who visited them with one of the chiefs of the
    Winnebagoes in 1767. The chief in the first place, addressed a brief
    invocation to the Manito, and then he made his offerings. In this
    instance he gave everything he possessed, that was valuable, including
    all his ornaments, together with his pipe and roll of tobacco. He
    concluded his acts of devotion<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> by asking the Great
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>Spirit to give
    them his protection, a bright sun, a blue sky, and untroubled waters.
    I visited the spot near which the chief must have stood upon that
    occasion. Much had been changed in the succeeding century, but the wild
    and tumultuous character of the falls, and the noise and foam caused by
    the rushing waters, are still very impressive.</p>

  <p>From Mendota I proceeded towards the north-west, in the direction of
    the Minnesota as far as Mankato, with the intention of crossing the
    prairies southwards towards Nebraska. It was also my purpose to visit
    the Winnebagoes at their reservation. This tribe had been removed
    from their lands near Lake Michigan, and settled a few miles from
    Mankato; but upon my arrival at that town, I was informed that they
    had been again removed to a reservation further west, to give room
    for the occupation of the land by the numerous emigrants from Europe,
    especially those thrifty, hard-working agriculturists, who came from
    Sweden and Norway. The new settlements in this part of Minnesota were
    still in an alarmed condition, in consequence of the memory of the
    massacres that had taken place a few years previously, when the Sioux
    rose in rebellion, and committed a grave series of atrocities upon the
    white inhabitants.</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of the war, thirty-eight of the chief perpetrators
    of cruelties upon the unoffending <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
    white people, were condemned to
    death and were hanged. The events that took place upon that occasion
    were described to me by an eye-witness, as having been exceedingly
    repulsive, in consequence of the defiant shouts and gestures of the
    prisoners. Hanging is a form of execution particularly disliked by
    Indians, because they consider that it is ignominious. The war was
    caused by a belief, spread among the tribes, that they had been treated
    with great injustice. They declared that they were not allowed to
    remain in possession of their lands, and that the treaties which had
    been made with them, had not been fairly carried out. The savage desire
    for revenge was aroused, and barbarous acts were committed by the
    Sioux, whilst they were in a state of passionate excitement.</p>

  <p>On a terrace overlooking the waters of the Minnesota, close to the
    spot where the Sioux had been executed, I met a half-breed Indian, who
    was known to have seen some of the unmerciful deeds that had taken
    place. I asked him to give me an explanation of the reasons that had
    caused the Sioux, most of whom had led peaceful lives, to suddenly
    avenge themselves in this brutal manner. He said, that whatever may
    have seemed to be their character, all these Dakotas had an inveterate
    hatred for the pale faces, who had deprived them of their lands,
    their hunting grounds, their freedom, and all that made their lives
    tolerable. After a pause, he observed in a harsh angry tone, that the
    women and children were killed, because, in cases such as these, it was
    a rule with Indians, to not only kill all the men, but also all who
    could become men or give birth to men, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> that it was their object to
    secure the total extermination of their enemies.</p>

  <p>I afterwards met, near the lands which had been occupied by the
    Winnebagoes, one of those waifs of civilization, who prefer the
    adventurous freedom of the Indians to the ordinary forms of existence
    among the whites. He was a Virginian by birth, and had left his home at
    an early age to join the Apaches, whose hunting grounds were near the
    borders of New Mexico. He lived with them for several years, and then,
    desiring a change, he had joined a band of Chippewas. He was given by
    them the name of Ara-po-gai-sik or Day-Catcher, because he was first
    observed when approaching their camp at daybreak. I found him to be a
    man of considerable intelligence, and conversant with the habits of the
    tribes with whom he had dwelt.</p>

  <p>It is unusual to find men of English descent electing, by their own
    wish, to entirely live with Indians. It seems to be different as
    regards the French or French Canadians, who appear to have certain
    instincts in their nature, which enable them to conform readily with
    the domestic customs of Indian life.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />
  <blockquote>
    <p>The subject of the claims of the Indians to the possession of
      their ancient hunting grounds, was brought to the notice of the
      United States Government during the time I was at Washington,
      after my return from Yucatan in the summer of 1870.</p>

    <p>A large deputation from the Ogallalas, a warlike tribe of
      Sioux, who dwelt on the prairies to the west of the Missouri,
      came to the city for the purpose of making a statement of their
      grievances, with regard to their lands. They declared that the
      treaties concerning them had not been faithfully carried out.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

    <p>The deputation consisted of the principal chief, an Indian
      named Red Cloud, who held a great reputation as a brave and
      daring warrior, and with him were Brave Bear, Rocky Bear, Red
      Dog, and other chiefs, who were also well known for their
      courage and fearlessness, which they had shown upon several
      occasions in fights upon the plains. Several men of the tribe
      accompanied them.</p>

    <p>I happened to see those Ogallalas frequently, under various
      circumstances; they had that power, which is characteristic
      with thoroughbred Indians, of assuming when thought necessary,
      a reserved and dignified manner. Red Cloud, especially,
      maintained the deportment consistent with his position as the
      hereditary chief of his nation.</p>

    <p>The speeches delivered by them in the presence of the
      Commissioner of Indian affairs were remarkable as proving
      that they possessed great natural oratorical abilities. The
      description of the events occurring in their territories, and
      the unfair treatment which they considered they had received,
      were expressed with much force and poetical imagination.</p>

    <p>Their appeals were, however, unavailing. It was made clear
      to them, that it was not possible, that small numbers of
      Indians could be permitted to retain possession of extensive
      grounds, to the exclusion of the necessities of an advancing
      civilization, and that they must accept the fate which was
      inevitable, and accustom themselves to be confined within
      reservations of a limited and definite area.</p>

    <p>The Secretary of the Interior, told the Sioux that the existing
      things were changing, and that they might as well try and keep
      back the winds with their hands, as to prevent these changes.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was getting late in the year, when I commenced to cross the prairies
    of Minnesota and Iowa. The higher plateaux were in many places already
    covered with snow, upon which we saw numerous tracks of wolves. The
    long icicles upon the graceful little waterfall of the Minne-ha-ha,
    indicated the approach of a severe winter, and flocks of wild geese
    were flying towards the upper lakes.</p>

  <p>For many miles the surface of the land looked black, in consequence
    of the prairie fires that had burnt the grass, during the latter part
    of the autumn. On the eastern borders, near the rivers, we passed
    some scattered villages, chiefly occupied by emigrants of Welsh or
    Scandinavian origin; but towards the interior the land was too wet
    and exposed for the purposes of cultivation. Here and there, on the
    plains, we saw the lonely huts of adventurous squatters, who obtained
    a precarious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
    living by supplying the wants of those who passed near
    them, on their way towards the South. At one of these dwellings
    situated upon the open plain, twenty miles from the nearest village,
    we halted after a long journey over a dreary country, forming the
    watershed of the streams that flowed east or west into the valleys of
    the Missouri and Mississippi.</p>

  <p>The hut was occupied by a man, who, with his wife and family, had
    been settled in this remote region for several years. As there was no
    timber to be obtained in the neighbourhood, he had built the walls of
    his house with wide, thick slabs of turf, which made a good protection
    against the storms of winter. He possessed one hundred and fifty acres
    of land, of which he only cultivated the small portion he had been
    able to preserve from the ravages of prairie fires. The difficulty of
    guarding the homestead against this danger, had caused him to feel much
    anxiety, but he said that he had, at last, discovered an effectual
    method of preventing any damage being caused, as far as his crops and
    buildings were concerned.</p>

  <p>He saw upon one occasion, that the grass was burning on the verge of
    the southern horizon, and the flames appeared to be advancing rapidly
    in the direction of his farm. It occurred to him to try the plan of
    running two plough furrows in parallel lines between the edge of his
    land and the approaching fire. He made them about twenty yards apart,
    and then burnt the grass, thus leaving a bare space of blackened earth.
    The flames advanced upon their onward course, destroying everything
    before them until they reached the outer furrow, when they were
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
    stopped by there not being any grass for fuel, and as they could not
    leap over the intervening space, the fire passed to the right and left,
    leaving the farm in the centre untouched. The prairie around this
    squatter’s home, was wild and dreary.</p>

  <p>The track led us over a region which had been shaped into hollows and
    undulations, caused by the action of numberless streams and rivulets
    which had cut their way in all directions. There were also many small
    depressions which contained pools of water. We observed in all these
    ponds numerous erratic boulders of various sizes. The majority of them
    were small, but others were of considerable magnitude, and must have
    weighed from fifteen to twenty tons. They were usually composed of
    red, green, and dark grey granites, similar to those I had seen on the
    surface of the country to the south-west of Lake Superior.</p>

  <p>The boulders were usually standing detached on the ground near the edge
    of the water, but sometimes they were heaped together in a pile in the
    middle of the pond. Upon an examination of the positions of the strange
    aggregations of stones which had been moved from their original place
    in the north to this plateau, the impression was conveyed to the mind
    that these smaller boulders may have been dropped during the period
    when icebergs were floating over the land. It seemed to be probable
    that some of the icebergs were stranded, and had left on these spots
    the cargo they had carried away from higher latitudes.</p>

  <p>Upon other parts of the level prairie where the land was dry, there
    were many isolated masses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
    standing up in their places upon the
    surface, in the same manner as the Spirit rock near Mendota. It was
    remarkable that these boulders, which were often very large, were not
    embedded in the soil, but appeared to have remained in the positions
    in which they had been deposited. Some of the larger ponds contain
    quantities of wild aquatic plants, which yield a kind of rice—the same
    which was frequently mentioned by the French exploring missionaries in
    the seventeenth century—by the name of La Folle Avoine. This wild rice
    was gathered by the Dakotas and Chippewas, and stored by them for food
    in time of scarcity.</p>

  <p>As we approached the boundaries of North Iowa, we found that the
    winter had set in earlier than usual, and the prairies were covered
    with several inches of snow. The aspect of the country, upon which the
    only marks of life were the footprints of animals, was exceedingly
    desolate. The horizon was sharply defined by the white edges of the
    land against the sky, and the curvature of the earth was thereby made
    distinct. The land seemed to fall away from the eye at a distance which
    looked very near. On plains of this perfectly level character in these
    latitudes, the actual true distance of the horizon—as seen by a person
    of average height standing upon the ground—would be about three miles;
    but in consequence of the conditions of light upon the surface of the
    snow, it appeared to be less, and the borders of the round line of
    horizon seemed to confine us within a small circle. This effect was
    particularly noticeable when the sun rose and touched the eastern parts
    of the curvature, the sky at that time in the morning being clear and
    cloudless.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

  <p>The weather became daily more severe, and at last we had to encounter
    a hard gale of wind from the north-west. Suddenly one afternoon, a
    sweeping snow storm overtook us, and in a few hours all vestiges of
    the track were lost. Our position became perilous, as nothing could be
    seen which would help us in the slightest degree as a guide, and enable
    us to steer a straight course. The sky was gloomy and dark with snow
    clouds, and the prairie was as bare as the open sea.</p>

  <p>The night was approaching, and matters were beginning to be serious,
    when the coach was stopped by striking against some concealed obstacle,
    and the horses swerved round. After gazing upon the fresh snow for
    a few seconds, the driver said that it was practically useless to
    attempt to follow the track, as it was impossible to make out its
    direction. It was evident that there was not the slightest reason for
    making any endeavours to follow one way more than any other, and we
    had the dangerous prospect before us of having to pass the night under
    circumstances of great hardship.</p>

  <p>Fortunately it was suggested, that we might try the experiment of
    maintaining a line of progress by attending to the point from which
    the wind came. It had been observed that, when we were going along the
    straight track, the wind was upon the right hand, nearly abeam, and it
    was considered possible that if we could manage to keep it upon that
    bearing, we ought finally to arrive at our destination. The driver
    thought that this plan did not offer much prospect of success, on
    account of the scattered boulders and the rough nature of the country.
    He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
    however decided to do what was proposed, and started forward. An
    unforeseen difficulty soon arose. The horses having no track before
    them to follow, kept constantly swerving to the left to avoid the wind,
    and it required much skill and energy to keep their heads pointed in
    the right direction.</p>

  <p>The obstructions we had to encounter, caused us much anxiety, for
    we were exposed to a bitterly cold gale, and the storm blew against
    us with a severity that was unendurable. It was with no slight
    pleasure that, just before the night, we saw upon the verge of the
    horizon ahead, the lights of the town where we intended to stop.
    When we arrived there, it was found that the roads had become almost
    impassable, in consequence of the great depth of the snow that had
    fallen in a few hours.</p>

  <p>As the prairies of Western Iowa had thus become a vast white
    table land, whose ground was hidden from view, I crossed the Missouri
    as soon as possible and proceeded to the interior of Nebraska where
    the storm had not taken place and the surface of the land was still in
    its autumnal condition. I stopped at various places in the valley of
    the river Platte and, at one of the newly formed settlements, obtained
    convenient quarters in the house of a man who had passed the greatest
    part of his life with the Pawnees, a tribe of Indians who have always
    been considered to hold an exceptional position with respect to their
    religious observances and language.</p>

  <p>He had lived in the tents and was well acquainted with their habits
    of life, and like all other men whom I had met who had been much
    in contact with the Indians, occupying the country west of the
    Mississippi, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
    he had been impressed by the reality of their personal
    faith in supernatural manifestations of power for good or evil.</p>

  <p>I was much interested in ascertaining the existence of certain facts
    which seemed to show analogies between these Pawnees and the race who
    under the name of Toltecs or Aztecs had migrated from some unknown
    country into Mexico. It has not hitherto been explained how it
    happened that this tribe who, as far as is known, have always lived
    in this region, placed in the centre of the continent, should possess
    a language which is absolutely different from that of any other race
    of North American Indians, and that they should have been, for a long
    period of time, surrounded by powerful tribes with whom they could
    never have held any spoken communications. Mr. Albert Gallatin, a
    learned American ethnologist, draws attention to their singularly
    isolated position. He states that “they speak a language altogether
    different from that of the Sioux tribes or of any other Indians known
    to us.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

  <p>They do not appear to have been a numerous race, for, when their
    territories were first explored, it was estimated that, including men,
    women and children, their numbers were under seven thousand. At the
    time that I passed through the ancient hunting grounds in Nebraska,
    their descendants (of whom there were said to be about three thousand)
    were gathered together in a reservation north of the Platte. I saw a
    few of them near the banks of that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
    river, and some others who had
    committed a series of ferocious acts on the plains and had carried
    off several scalps. They were captured, imprisoned and condemned to
    death. These men were wild-looking savages who stalked restlessly round
    the cells in which they were confined like intractable and untameable
    animals. Those I saw wandering near the Platte had, for some unknown
    reason, dressed themselves in war paint. Their eyes were encircled by
    broad bands of red ochre. Their faces were covered with blue stripes
    which in their outlines resembled the tattoed lines of the Maoris in
    New Zealand.</p>

  <p>The natural colour of the Pawnees I met was rather darker than the
    skins of the Sioux and Chippewas. The men were of more than the
    ordinary stature and were powerfully built. Their heads were broad and
    massive and all of them had remarkably high cheek bones.</p>

  <p>The early explorers, sent by the Government towards the West, did
    not learn much about the superstitions of the native tribes, but it
    is mentioned in the Report of the Expedition to the Rocky Mountains
    in 1819–20 that the Pawnees, then living near the forks of the river
    Loup in the valley of the Platte, had originally a custom, which was
    believed to be annual but was no longer followed, of offering a human
    sacrifice to the Great Star.</p>

  <p>The victim was always a prisoner that had been captured in war.</p>

  <p>Mr. James, one of the members of the exploring party, stated that the
    star to which the sacrifice was made, was the planet Venus. It is
    probable therefore that this ceremony had some connection with the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
    worship of the sun, as the Indians, who were accurate observers of all
    natural events, would have noticed that Venus, both as a morning and
    evening star, appeared to govern the movements of the greater light,
    and either announced its approach at dawn or followed its departure at
    sunset.</p>

  <p>The Pawnees and the Dakotas are the only North American tribes known
    to have had the custom of killing human beings, for the purpose of
    presenting them to their gods as propitiations in time of distress, or
    as thanksgiving offerings after successful wars. The sacrifices made to
    their gods of war by the Aztecs were probably introduced into Mexico
    by that fierce race. The last human sacrifice offered by the Pawnees
    occurred in the year 1837, and in this case it is believed that the
    offering was made to the spirit who caused the land to produce fertile
    crops.</p>

  <p>A young girl of fourteen years of age had been captured during a war
    with the Sioux, and it was decided that she was to be killed and
    sacrificed to this particular Manito. The strange character of the
    method of immolation arrests attention. The girl was carefully secured
    upon a framework made of light poles, raised a few feet above the
    ground. When she was in the right position for the sacrifice, a fire
    was kindled beneath, but before the flames had actually begun to
    touch her, and precisely at the moment when it was perceived that the
    fire was sufficiently strong to begin to burn her, she was suddenly
    killed by a flight of arrows.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> She was then
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>taken down from the
    scaffolding and the flesh was cut into small portions and taken away
    into the fields, where the blood was sprinkled over certain parts of
    the land which had been planted.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption smcap">Sha-to-Ko (Blue Hawk). A Pawnee.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The fact of a sacrifice so important as that of a girl on the verge of
    womanhood being made to the god believed to have power over all matters
    relating to the growth of corn and other vegetable produce, proves that
    the Pawnees cultivated the earth to a greater extent than other tribes.
    Their neighbours, the Dakotas, were more exclusively a hunting race,
    and their human sacrifices, as far as has been ascertained by events
    that have happened within the past century, were usually made for the
    purpose of propitiation in the more solemn forms of Sun worship, or of
    appeasing the anger of evil spirits or demons when manifested by storms
    of lightning and thunder.</p>

  <p>My host told me that during the time he had lived amongst the Pawnees
    he had not seen anything in their observances which led him to suppose
    that they had any kind of belief in a future state beyond this world,
    or in any absolutely over-ruling Power. The few ceremonies performed by
    them were apparently propitiations of the various supernatural Manitos
    who, they considered, had influence over them either individually or
    as a tribe. One of their most frequent practices consisted of offering
    incense to them in the form of tobacco smoke, and they invariably
    presented it in the same manner by throwing the first whiff upwards
    towards the sky, the next downwards to the ground and then to the right
    and left. He had also observed that when
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> this act was finished, each
    Indian seemed to mutter some brief ejaculation or prayer.</p>

  <p>With respect to their superstitions he thought that they were
    practically spiritualists, and believed in the presence of unknown and
    unseen influences below, above or around them, having each in their own
    separate degree powers of good or evil. He mentioned an event which had
    happened within his personal observation.</p>

  <p>A Pawnee during a violent storm was injured by a flash of lightning.
    The tribe were convinced that this misfortune had been inflicted upon
    him as a direct punishment for some wrong deed he had committed, or
    that he had in some way, by his own conduct incurred the displeasure of
    the god of Lightning. As a consequence of this belief, he was avoided,
    and compelled to live apart, as a man placed under a curse or malignant
    influence.</p>

  <p>These Pawnees had the reputation of being cruel to their prisoners,
    and in that respect had the same usages as the Iroquois who tortured
    the captives and then burnt them at the stake.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> All North
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>American
    tribes appear to have similar habits when their savage natures are
    aroused by bloodshed and war, but it is also acknowledged by those who
    have had an intimate knowledge of them, that under other and milder
    conditions, they possess <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
    qualities of an affectionate nature, which
    are shown in their domestic lives. An event occurred not far from the
    settlement which exemplified their attachment to their children.</p>

  <p>The only child of a Pawnee and his wife died and was buried in a grave
    dug in the open prairie near a spot where a small band of Indians
    had temporarily erected their tents. In the grave with the child
    were placed all the things which had belonged to her, including her
    mocassin shoes, her plate and cup and her trinkets. Her father had in
    his possession a good set of sleigh bells, said to be worth seventeen
    dollars which he had intended to sell to one of the white men in the
    neighbourhood, but after the death of his daughter he said that he was
    happy because no one had yet bought his bells, for he was consequently
    able to give them to her, and they were put by the child’s side and
    buried. The father and mother then built round the grave a wooden fence
    to keep the wolves away, as the Pawnees were going to move their tents
    to a distant part of the country. This fence was shortly afterwards
    destroyed by a prairie fire, and the place of the grave is not now
    known.</p>

  <p>These fires are becoming less frequent and, when they occur, are
    attributable to carelessness. I happened to see one of them sweeping
    over the plains near the river Missouri, my position at the time being
    at right angles to the line of its direction. A high wind was blowing
    from the South-west and the tall grass was bent over in such a manner
    that the flames instead of going with the wind towards the North-east,
    caught the tops of the grass and consequently travelled steadily to
    windward in the teeth <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
    of the gale. The smoke rolled away to leeward
    in dense clouds and the flames leapt upwards on tongues of fire to
    heights of twenty or thirty feet. The movement forward was like that of
    the rapidly advancing crest of a breaking wave. I estimated the length
    of the front of the fire to be nearly two miles.</p>

  <p>When wandering over the wide Iowa and Nebraska plains, many problems
    present themselves to the mind with regard to their formation and
    existing condition. Of these, none are so perplexing to the farmers
    as those which relate to the absence of trees. Several theories have
    been mooted and many conclusions have been adopted, and thought to be
    rational, but as a rule they cannot be accepted as being altogether
    satisfactory. One of the most general opinions, is that the treeless
    state of the land has been caused by the destructive effects of fire.
    Another opinion is that which attributes the greatest counteracting
    influence to the nature of the soil.</p>

  <p>One of the most careful investigators into this subject was the
    accomplished geologist Mr. J. W. Foster, whom I met at Chicago, and
    who was at that time President of the American Association for the
    Advancement of Science. He told me what had been the results of his
    work, and accompanied me to parts of the outlying Illinois prairies,
    to examine the character of the earth near the surface. He had, a
    short time previously, carried out a series of experiments relating to
    the physical geography of the Mississippi valley, and had given his
    attention to the composition of the upper formation of the prairies on
    both sides of the river.</p>

  <p>He had arrived at the conclusion that the absence of trees upon them
    was not caused by fires or by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
    character of the ground, but was the
    consequence of the conditions of rainfall, temperature, climate, and
    exposure, all acting in a direction opposed to that natural order of
    things in which trees would be inclined to flourish.</p>

  <p>On the way south from Mankato, I observed that the banks of the Des
    Moines river were thickly timbered, and that on the borders of the
    various rivulets which had cut their way through the ground to a
    considerable depth, there was usually a flourishing growth of trees,
    chiefly consisting of oak, black walnut, basswood, and maple varieties.
    In all these instances the trees were sheltered, but on the exposed
    prairie immediately adjacent the ground was bare, and without a vestige
    of any signs of trees or shrubs. In that particular region it seems
    therefore probable, that the exposure to gales of wind sweeping over
    the plateau, may be the principal cause of trees not being able to take
    root and live.</p>

  <p>There are, however, other prairies equally bare of timber which are
    not so exposed. Upon those situated near the water shed or dividing
    ridge of the tributaries of the Missouri and Mississippi, it may be
    the quantities of water lying permanently within a few feet below the
    surface which prevent any growth taking place. No single theory seems
    to explain the facts, but from my own observation, I am inclined to
    think that the chief deterring influence is the nature of the soil.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

  <p>There is an unexplained problem respecting the growth of trees
    in certain parts of North America, which has received much local
    notice. My attention was directed to the subject when I was in the
    neighbourhood of Lake Simcoe in Upper Canada. An Englishman, who had
    established a homestead there and made clearings in the forests, told
    me he had observed that after the old trees had been felled, new shrubs
    and timber of an entirely different character grew up in their place.
    There was nothing in the nature of the surrounding woods which, to his
    mind, could account for the change, as there were no trees of the class
    that had taken root existing in that part of the country.</p>

  <p>A similar alteration in the order of succession of forest growths was
    reported by the geologists employed by the Government in conducting
    the early surveys of Michigan. They stated that large tracts of land,
    originally covered with pines, had been succeeded by a second growth
    consisting of white birch, aspen, pine and hazel. In this case the
    primeval forest had been destroyed by high winds and afterwards
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> burnt.
    It was supposed that where clearings had been made by fire, changes
    of the above nature occurred, but no suggestions were given as to the
    manner in which these new and strange growths established themselves.</p>

  <p>Near Ishpeming, I saw that in all cases where forest openings had been
    made by the action of fire, luxuriant masses of dense raspberry bushes
    occupied the land; and it was said that where the woods were cut down
    by the axe bushes of another class, bearing different berries, sprang
    up and flourished.</p>

  <p>In other parts of the North-west, variations in the succession of
    forest trees have been seen to occur; and usually there seems to be
    some connection between the type of the new plants and the methods by
    which the clearings have been made. As a general rule there are very
    few birds to carry seeds or pips from distant regions and therefore
    it is possible that in places where the ground has never for many
    centuries been previously disturbed and where the thick forest has
    been for the first time removed, and sunlight and fresh atmospheric
    conditions are admitted upon the land, new circumstances arise which
    are favourable to the development of dormant life.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

  <p>Before leaving the valley of the Platte I made several excursions on
    the plains for the purpose of examining two of the most extensive of
    those singular groups of mounds which have been called prairie-dog
    villages. The largest of them was situated about two hundred miles west
    of the Missouri and three miles north of the Platte. It occupied a
    space exceeding fifty acres, which was covered by the rounded heaps of
    earth and pebbles thrown up by the little marmots when excavating their
    burrows. These creatures, when they are sitting on the tops of their
    mounds in a watchful attitude keeping a sharp look out around them and
    holding their paws before them, resemble a colony of ground squirrels.
    When I was at a certain distance from them they maintained continuous
    and defiant sounds like the shrill
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
    yelps of puppies, but upon a nearer
    approach they suddenly disappeared down their holes.</p>

  <p>The existence of these isolated groups of burrowing animals, dwelling
    together in communities, was made the subject of observation by
    the expeditions sent by the United States Government to explore
    these regions, and it was reported that it was not unusual to find
    rattlesnakes living in the same holes as the prairie dogs. Captain
    Stansfield, the leader of one of these exploring parties, stated that
    the holes were generally guarded by a rattlesnake, and that when the
    hand was about to be thrust into the hole to draw out the prairie dog
    which had been shot at, but had got into its burrow, the ominous rattle
    of the reptile was heard within.</p>

  <p>Twenty years had elapsed since that time, and many changes had taken
    place in the conditions of animal life upon these plains. I thrust
    my stick down various holes but there were no rattlesnakes in them.
    I afterwards heard that in these districts the reptiles, which had
    been so numerous, had disappeared. Another group of these village
    communities which I examined was placed to the south of the Platte.
    Although it covered a comparatively small area it was more fully
    tenanted and the dwellings were closer together, each mound almost
    touching its neighbour. One of the young occupiers of this village
    had been captured and tamed by a squatter living near the settlement
    in which I was then stopping. As it rarely happens that the habits of
    these marmots can be regularly observed, this creature’s actions were
    noticed with great curiosity.</p>

  <p>It was the daily habit of this prairie dog to sit
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>for hours upon
    its haunches, with its fore-paws held steadily in front of him,
    continuously maintaining a careful watch upon everything that was
    happening. I observed that although the method of sitting was that
    of the squirrel tribe, the shape and appearance of the body was of
    a different type, and like that of a large guinea-pig. The most
    attractive point about the little animal was its keen manner of keeping
    guard like a sentinel. Nothing seemed to escape its vigilance.</p>

      <span class="small">(the mounds are about eighteen inches high.)</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>When the fact of rattlesnakes living in the same holes as the prairie
    dogs was originally made known, there were several theories advanced
    upon the subject; but, in the absence of any direct evidence as to
    the nature of the apparent alliance or friendship, nothing could be
    positively proved. It was however subsequently discovered that young
    marmots were occasionally found inside the bodies of rattlesnakes which
    had been killed near the mounds. It is therefore probable that the
    reptiles used the burrows for their winter residences, after having
    expelled the previous inhabitants.</p>

  <p>Nothing is more surprising than the effect of the movement of
    civilisation westwards upon the number of the animals who were
    accustomed to exist upon the prairies. The explorers who passed through
    these waste lands in the beginning of the nineteenth century, reported
    that the surface of the country, especially near the river Platte, was
    often blackened by immense herds of bisons. Fifty years later when I
    went over the same ground no buffaloes were to be seen there, and they
    no longer frequented that part of Nebraska. The rattlesnakes have also
    almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
    disappeared in consequence of the introduction of animals that
    were hostile to them.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

  <p>The manner by which this destruction of the snake tribe has been
    carried out, was brought to my notice when I was crossing Lake Erie.
    Near the west shores of the lake there were several islands which had
    been infested with reptiles to such an extent as to make it dangerous
    for men to land upon them. A resident who had lived for many years upon
    the adjacent shore, and who happened to be on board the steamer when we
    passed near one of the largest of the islands, told me that in order
    to clear the ground a large number of hogs were landed upon it, and
    within a short time the island was made perfectly safe. It was observed
    that they rushed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
    immediately forward and when close to the snakes they
    dropped upon their knees and commenced to devour them with the greatest
    avidity. The darting of the fangs upon them did not seem to have the
    slightest injurious effect. It is therefore probable that this strange
    invulnerability of the hog is due to the thickness of its hide, and the
    close stiff bristles which prevent the penetration of the poison.</p>

  <p>On the prairies, the explorers mention their having seen, besides
    buffaloes, deer, hares, wolves, eagles, buzzards and ravens. I saw
    several herds of antelopes and a few wolves: one of them belonging to
    the coyote species was observed in the evening to be prowling round
    the huts of settlers at the forks of the Platte. It was caught and
    forthwith dispatched. It was a good sized wolf with a thick coat of
    shaggy iron-grey hair and looked fierce and savage. On the banks of
    the southern branch of the river near this spot I joined an American
    companion in an expedition to look for prairie grouse. We found them
    amongst the brushwood in considerable numbers, but the birds were wild
    and it was difficult to get within range of them. The Platte at this
    part was nearly three thousand feet above the sea.</p>

  <p>On the desert, at a height of seven thousand feet, I saw antelopes
    grazing upon the prairie grass which was growing abundantly and
    afforded ample supplies of food for them. Wolves were also on these
    plains skulking in the vicinity doubtless hoping to appease their
    hunger before many hours had elapsed. These wide and lofty table lands
    were the ancient hunting grounds of the Dakotas and Cheyennes.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>It was getting late upon a fine winter’s evening when our coach crossed
    the brow of a hill and we caught sight of the calm blue waters of the
    Great Salt Lake surrounded by snow-covered mountains. It was a quiet
    scene of singular beauty. The skies were brilliant with the glowing
    effects caused by the rays of the declining sun. It was nearly dark
    when we arrived at the City of the Mormons and our horses were pulled
    up at the door of an attractive little inn which Brigham Young had
    provided for the accommodation of strangers.</p>

  <p>After quitting the prosperous lands of Utah on my way to California
    I stopped in the centre of that part of the American desert situated
    near the borders of Oregon and bounded on the west by the ranges of the
    Sierra Nevada. It was my object to visit a tribe of Shoshones who were
    then encamped in the neighbourhood. I found them dwelling on a dreary
    and exposed plateau in the midst of a region covered with small black
    volcanic stones and fragments (or flakes) of obsidian, with which an
    old arrow head maker was busily engaged fashioning the rude weapons
    required by the tribe. It was the middle of December. The winter was
    cold, and the country around looked bleak and desolate.</p>

  <p>The Indians were in wigwams made of saplings or withies, bent over
    in such a manner as to form the shape of a semi-circle or a low
    rounded beehive. They resembled, in their construction and size, the
    temporary huts used by wandering bands of Chippewas upon the shores of
    Lake Superior. The interiors of these rude and miserable lodges were
    not inviting. Squalor, dirt and gloom were present to the eye, and

  <p>The men differed to some extent from all other Indians that I had seen,
    and were in appearance like the Asiatics in the southern Provinces
    of China, and had not the massive heads and aquiline features of the
    Dakotas or Pawnees; they were also of a more debased type. This,
    however, may have been the result of many centuries of struggles
    against starvation and exposure to the severe weather that must be
    experienced in the deserts upon which they wander. Outside the main
    part of the encampment there was a small group of wigwams, which I
    found to be occupied by Utes, a tribe even more degraded and wretched
    than the Shoshones.</p>

  <p>The Utes, or Digger Indians, have always been considered to be the
    lowest in civilization of all the American tribes. It has been thought
    that they may be the descendants of outcasts, but this opinion does not
    seem to be based upon sufficient evidence. There are good reasons for
    believing that they are allied in race and language with the Shoshones,
    and they are apparently treated by them on terms of friendship and
    equality.</p>

  <p>The Diggers have been given that name in consequence of it being
    their custom to live chiefly upon roots, or whatever other food they
    can obtain by digging. They also find a scanty support from grass,
    seeds and locusts. They have been occasionally met wandering in Utah
    in a naked and half-starved condition. It is not possible to imagine
    human beings to be in a lower or more harsh state of existence. Misery
    and want do not however appear to influence the natural buoyancy and
    cheerfulness of these nomads. Possibly their freedom, the constant
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
    occupation of searching the hills and deserts for subsistence, and
    their unconstrained life, give them compensation for the hardships that
    they are forced to endure.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is only one other race that I have seen living under
      similar conditions of continuous want and wretchedness, with
      whom the struggles for bare existence are equally severe.</p>

    <p>That unfortunate people are the Fuegians, who wander in search
      of food upon the rugged coasts of Tierra del Fuego.</p>

    <p>When passing through the Straits of Magellan in H.M.S. Pearl
      in January, 1877, we saw several families of the natives in
      Churruca Bay occupying wretched wigwams, placed close to the
      water’s edge.</p>

    <p>Some of them embarked in their canoes and came alongside to ask
      for food and tobacco. They appeared to be in a half-starved
      and emaciated state, and were sustaining life upon mussel and
      edible roots. The medical officers of the ship measured the
      men, as I wished to ascertain their size and weight as compared
      with the Patagonians dwelling upon the opposite shores of the
      Straits. It was found that the height of these Fuegians was
      between four feet nine inches and five feet two inches. The
      average stature was under five feet. The measurements round
      the chest were comparatively large, being thirty-four to
      thirty-five inches.</p>

   <p>We afterwards anchored in Gregory Bay, Patagonia. As soon as we
      were observed, a numerous tribe of Patagonians rode down to the
      beach, and pitched their tents opposite the ship. Several of
      the chiefs came on board and subsequently allowed themselves to
      be weighed and measured.</p>

    <p>It was ascertained that their average height was five feet
      eleven inches, and their chest measurements averaged forty-four
      inches. Their weights averaged two hundred and thirty-two
      pounds.</p>

    <p>The contrast in the physical condition between the Patagonians
      and Fuegians is extraordinary when it is considered that only a
      narrow channel of water, easily traversed by canoes, separates
      them. It is probable that the Utes, Shoshones and Fuegians
      may have been forced by adverse circumstances to retreat to
      the inhospitable regions in which they live. No race would
      willingly accept or undergo such unchangeable hardships.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is expedient with respect to the condition of the North American
    Indians, to take into consideration some of the circumstances relating
    to their languages, customs, and superstitions; particularly such of
    them as may appear to have remote analogies with the observances of
    other races, or with the more advanced state of civilisation that
    existed in the fifteenth century, among the tribes who had conquered
    the aboriginal inhabitants of Mexico, Central America, and Yucatan.
    It is also especially necessary that a brief investigation should
    be directed to certain exceptional forms of the Indian faith in the
    influence and power of the unknown gods by whom the Dakotas believed
    themselves to be surrounded and who were propitiated by acts of severe
    personal suffering and penance.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

  <p>In the Northern continent there are two principal facts which attract
    the attention of those who are thrown into contact with the Iroquois,
    Chippewas and Dakotas. The first of these which comes under notice
    is the extraordinary number and diversity of their languages, and
    afterwards, upon a more extended acquaintance with the customs of these
    Indians, the strange and most grave nature of the higher character of
    their ancient religion. With regard to the differences of the languages
    my attention was first called to this circumstance by M. Cuoq, who,
    when I visited the Missionary establishment upon the shores of the “Lac
    des deux Montagnes” in Canada, was in charge of the converts. M. Cuoq
    was a learned philologist and had published a volume of studies upon
    the Indian languages.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

  <p>The assemblage of Roman Catholic converts brought together at the
    Mission was composed of two tribes, who spoke different languages
    which were so absolutely distinct that they were unable to converse
    with each other. One of these groups were Algonquins, whose ancestors
    originally dwelt to the north of the St. Lawrence, the other was formed
    from the Iroquois who came from territories bordering upon the southern
    banks of that river. M. Cuoq, when conducting the religious services,
    preached to them in their own languages alternately. It is not
    surprising that these scattered remnants of the two great tribes whose
    languages were radically dissimilar should still (although they have
    lived as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
    neighbours for several generations) be unable to understand
    each other. It is, however, a different matter when the conditions
    are considered under which the original Iroquois language has become
    changed into the six languages spoken by the Senecas, Oneidas,
    Cayugas, Onondagas, Mohawks and Tuscaroras. The extraordinary manner
    in which the Iroquois language has thus become separated is especially
    noticeable at the Canadian reservation of those tribes situated near
    the banks of the Grand River.</p>

  <p>According to the traditions of the Iroquois it appears that the nations
    were composed originally of one large tribe, all of whom spoke one
    language, and that they dwelt on the southern shores of Lake Ontario.
    It is stated that they became too numerous for the land which they
    occupied, and a great council was held to consider what steps should
    be taken to establish themselves in such a manner as to have hunting
    grounds sufficiently extensive to enable them to obtain supplies
    of food. After long discussion it was decided to disperse and to
    divide into communities. But, in order to prevent disaster from the
    possibility of being conquered by their enemies when thus separated,
    it was arranged that they should dwell near each other and thus be
    able to unite for the purpose of war. It happened, in consequence of
    this dispersion, that the language gradually became so greatly changed
    that the tribes were unable to understand each other, and in a period
    comparatively brief, six distinct dialects were formed which in the
    course of time became practically new languages.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

  <p>When these Iroquois, who had been our allies in war, were gathered
    together and placed upon lands within the Canadian frontier, it was
    found expedient by them to make one of the dialects a language, which
    might be so far understood by the six nations, as to be employed upon
    all occasions when they had to perform their ceremonies, or carry out
    any purposes which they had in common.</p>

  <p>Upon the occasion of my visit to their reservation, I was accompanied
    by two Indians respectively of the Seneca and Cayuga tribes, both
    of whom spoke English intelligibly. I asked the Seneca what was the
    dialect they had chosen to be their language when the Iroquois were
    assembled together. He replied, that it was the Cayuga, because
    they believed it was the original language which had been spoken by
    all of them, and the six nations at the Grand River had learnt it
    sufficiently to enable them to understand what was said when they met
    at the Council house, but, for all ordinary purposes, and amongst
    themselves, each nation spoke its own dialect. With reference to this
    subject of variations in language, it is evident that amongst the
    North American Indians, who are scattered over such a large extent of
    country, the differences in the spoken tongues of the tribes must,
    in many instances, be caused by the fact of there being no written
    language, and of their being divided into races, kept apart by wars.
    It is therefore to be expected that great changes would occur within
    comparatively short intervals of time. With tribes originally belonging
    to one nation, these would rapidly become formed into dialects
    according to the manner in which the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> tribes moved into other hunting
    grounds, and became settled into distinct tribal groups. But after
    making all due allowances for these conditions, it still remains
    difficult to understand how so great a number of languages have become
    established amongst a comparatively small population. At no time, since
    the discovery of America, have the total numbers of Indians within the
    regions now forming the United States, exceeded five hundred thousand
    men, women and children. In 1829, it was estimated that the Indian
    population slightly exceeded three hundred and thirteen thousand. In
    1850, according to the census, the total numbers were four hundred
    thousand.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

  <p>The most remarkable fact with regard to the Iroquois tribes is that,
    after having had one original language, they should have become
    unintelligible to each other, although they lived in close proximity.
    Their territories were within the limits now occupied by the State
    of New York. With the Dakotas and Chippewas, whose territories are
    adjacent, the conditions are different, for these languages have no
    relation with each other, and the most careful researches have failed
    to trace any connection between them. The Chippewa dialect belongs to
    the group of languages classified as Algonquin. Dialects belonging to
    that original stock are spoken by the Chippewas, Ottawas, Illinois,
    Shawnees, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
    all the New England tribes. The Dakota language is at
    present known to be spoken in thirteen principal dialects, and several
    sub-divisions. The Iroquois is exclusively confined to the six dialects
    spoken by the six nations assembled in their reservations.</p>

  <p>The history of the dispersion of this race seems to establish the fact
    that Indian languages can, within a comparatively short period, be so
    greatly altered as to become practically distinct. This has happened
    with a nation whose separated tribes have always remained at peace with
    each other and have united for common defence, or for the prosecution
    of a war against powerful enemies. With savage nations whose original
    languages are essentially dissimilar, the constant wars which take
    place between them possibly introduce elements of change which would
    influence very considerably the spoken dialects of the opposing tribes.
    It was a frequent custom after the conclusion of hostilities for the
    conquerors to incorporate in their tribe the women and children of
    those whom they had vanquished. Thus a new dialect would be introduced
    amongst them, and the two languages would necessarily become blended. A
    succession of wars would cause a continuance of variations of language,
    and thus it would gradually come to pass that dialects would be formed
    not only greatly differing from each other, but most difficult to trace
    to any positive origin.</p>

  <p>The Iroquois were not only exceptional in having a fixed system of
    confederation which enabled them to combine their forces in a manner
    which increased their fighting strength, but they also had special
    customs with regard to their chiefs. It was established
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>amongst them
    as an unalterable regulation that their hereditary descent should be
    in the female line. This unusual system has attracted much attention.
    When I was at their reservation I asked my Indian companions for an
    explanation of the manner in which this was carried into effect in
    ordinary practice, for it seemed to involve difficulties with regard to
    intermarriage between the respective nations, and I wished to hear some
    direct evidence upon that subject.</p>

  <p>The Seneca said: “Our children always take the rank of their mothers
    and join their tribe; thus I, a Seneca, not a chief, married a Cayuga
    woman the daughter of a chief and my son is therefore a Cayuga and
    will be a chief of the Cayugas.” Another Indian said: “I live with the
    Cayugas and my father was a Cayuga, but I am an Onondaga because my
    mother was an Onondaga woman.”</p>

  <p>Whilst I was talking with these men, and passing through the villages
    of the Oneidas, Senecas and Tuscaroras, I observed that there was no
    church or any building set apart for religious purposes and I asked
    the Seneca how this happened, as in the other Iroquois reservations
    that I had seen, the church usually was in a prominent position near
    the centre of the settlement. He said that I was amongst men who were
    called Pagan Indians, and that the Grand River Iroquois were divided
    into two classes, Christians and Pagans. The former were settled upon a
    part of the lands a few miles distant. He also told me that they always
    kept themselves distinct from the converts, and were careful to follow
    their ancient belief and maintain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
    as far as possible, the ceremonies
    and religious customs of their ancestors.</p>

  <p>I asked a Cayuga, who had joined us, and who was one of the leading men
    of his tribe, if he would tell me to what extent, and in what form,
    their Pagan worship was practised. I also mentioned, that I wished for
    information with regard to the Iroquois belief in a Supreme Being.
    It was ascertained by the Jesuit missionaries, that a belief in one
    over-ruling Power was found to exist among them, and in this respect
    they differed from all other American Indians, with whom it seemed
    to be conclusively ascertained, that their worship only consisted of
    propitiations of the various powers that they believed had influence
    for good or evil in connection with matters around them. It was found
    by the priests, that the chief obstacle in enabling the savages to
    comprehend the meaning of their teaching, was the want of capacity
    in the minds of the Indians to understand the nature of a Power who
    controlled all movements of the heavens and earth. It was consequently
    interesting to meet an Indian who could intelligently explain this
    unusual peculiarity of the Iroquois belief.</p>

  <p>This Cayuga, in reply to my questions, said, “We all believe in the
    Great Spirit whom we call How-wan-ni-yu, and we have four feasts in
    every year made to him. Those at the New Year and at the Harvest time
    are the greatest. We meet at the Long House<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> dressed, as was the
    custom in former times, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
    with skins and feathers, and have our faces
    painted. In the middle of the room we place our offerings of wheat,
    fruit, tobacco, and flesh, according to what we can give, and the
    season of the year. Round this pile of offerings we have a dance. After
    this is over, our principal chief makes a speech and tells us about the
    goodness and nature of How-wan-ni-yu. Then we have another dance, after
    which another chief makes a speech, and so on, until all the speeches
    are finished. Then all the offerings are divided amongst us and the
    meeting ends.”</p>

  <p>I asked the Indians if they had any other kind of worship or prayer.
    They said they had nothing more, and that the dance to How-wan-ni-yu
    was not considered by them to be a prayer, but was meant as an
    acknowledgment of the goodness of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
    harvest. I found a difficulty
    in obtaining from these Iroquois any definite opinion with regard to
    their ideas of the nature of How-wan-ni-yu, but at last the Cayuga
    said abruptly: “We consider him to be the maker of all things upon
    the earth, and we know nothing more about the matter.” There were,
    originally, various ceremonies performed by the tribes in connection
    with the appearance of the first new moon of the year, and there
    were also tribal dances after any success in hunting or in war, but
    these are no longer performed. One of the new moon ceremonies was the
    sacrifice of a dog by fire, and the ashes were scattered over the
    ground as an offering.</p>

  <p>Upon leaving the reservation, it was not possible to feel otherwise
    than regret that it had become the fate of the descendants of a
    powerful nation of warriors to be penned within these restricted
    limits. Men, women and children, were leading aimless and useless
    lives. They were pensioners upon Governments which would gladly escape
    from the duties and expenses which the existence of these Indians
    demand, and who are, in many cases, victims to the temptations offered
    to them by the habits of modern civilisation.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

  <p>The Dakotas and the Iroquois have always been considered as the most
    powerful and warlike of the aboriginal races of North America. Both of
    these tribes also possessed, certain religious customs relating to the
    mental and physical training of their youthful warriors, which were
    intended to strengthen their characters, and to give them the power to
    endure privations and suffering with fortitude. The Dakotas carried
    into effect their observances to an extent far beyond that of any other
    race. Their superstitions and religious ceremonies, with reference
    to this system of preparing the foundations for the establishment of
    the qualities required to enable a Dakota to fulfil his duties as a
    courageous and honourable member of his tribe, are most characteristic,
    and appear to be invaluable elements in the formation of the qualities
    required by a race dwelling in wild and desolate lands, surrounded
    by enemies. It was an invariable rule with all the Dakotas, that the
    youths upon reaching manhood, should pass through a probationary
    period of fasting. This was done for the purpose of enabling each
    young Dakota to obtain a knowledge of the spiritual world by which he
    was surrounded, and to learn, by the revelations that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>would be made
    to him in dreams, the nature of the Manito which would influence his
    thoughts and actions during his life. The fasts were always performed
    in solitude, far away from the tribe, and frequently continued for a
    considerable time. It was supposed that towards the latter part of this
    probation, his dreams would give him an insight into the mysterious
    conditions of life and nature that appeared to be supernatural, and
    that he would discover the god, animal or other object to which he was
    especially linked and which he was to propitiate by sacrifices.</p>

  <p>It was an essential part of this early endurance of trial and
    abstinence, that it not only should be performed in secret, but that
    for the remainder of his life the Indian should hold his faith in
    silence, and never communicate to others what his dreams had revealed
    to him. Thus far this early initiation into the mysteries of the
    unknown world had practically the effect of establishing the mental
    character, and was a form of training which impressed upon each Indian
    a separate individuality. Upon the conclusion of the probation of
    fasting and solitude, the youths had each to pass through trials of
    their physical endurance, and had to suffer various tortures to prove
    themselves to be capable of becoming warriors, and to show their
    manhood by their power of bearing pain with unflinching fortitude.</p>

  <p>When I was in that part of the continent which for long periods of
    time had been occupied by the branch of the Dakota race called Sioux,
    I endeavoured to ascertain the nature and practice of these customs as
    far as they were known by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
    existing Indians. In prosecuting these
    researches into a subject so interesting and exclusive, I was fortunate
    in meeting with a man so well informed upon all matters connected
    with these Indians as the half-breed Faribault. He had lived with the
    Sioux for many years at the time when they had possession of lands
    bordering upon the banks of the Mississippi, and had been present, on
    several occasions, when their most serious superstitious ceremonies
    were performed. Amongst these were the propitiations made to the sun, a
    form of worship which was more rigidly and earnestly practised by the
    Dakotas than by any other nation in North America.</p>

  <p>Sun worship existed amongst all the Indian tribes dwelling in the
    Mississippi valley, particularly with the Natchez in Louisiana, but
    the manner and the ceremonies differed, and with none of them were the
    painful personal sufferings and penances, undergone by the worshippers,
    so great as they were with the Dakotas. An instance of the severity
    of this penance occurred in the year 1849, when Faribault was living
    with a Sioux tribe encamped on the western shores of the Mississippi,
    near Prairie la Crosse. “An Indian,” he said, “dreamt that he had
    incurred the displeasure of the Great Spirit, and that it was necessary
    to appease him by sacrificing to him everything that he valued, and
    also to perform penance by undergoing the utmost pain that he was
    able to endure. A scaffolding was raised near the camp, consisting of
    two upright poles—of sufficient length—which were firmly fixed in the
    ground. These were connected near the top by a cross pole. When this
    was completed the Indian stood up and, shortly
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> before daybreak, a cut
    was made within the fleshy parts of each arm near the shoulders through
    which was passed a rope. Cuts or holes were then made in the breasts
    and other ropes were pushed through them. The cords were then tied to
    the stakes in such a manner that the arms were suspended by them. The
    breast ropes were secured in a position such as to allow that a certain
    portion of the man’s weight was held by them. His feet were allowed
    just to touch the ground. His dog was killed and placed in front of
    him together with his blanket, cut into strips, his feathers, his
    ornaments, and all that he possessed.</p>

  <p>“When these preparations were made the Indian waited for the rising
    of the sun, and directly it appeared above the eastern horizon he
    threw his head back and fixing his gaze upon it commenced dancing. His
    friends at the same time maintained an incessant beating of a small
    drum. The dancing continued throughout the day, the Indian moving his
    position as the sun moved and taking care always to keep the sun in his
    front and to gaze steadfastly upon it without shrinking from its full
    light. After sunset he remained watching the western sky throughout the
    night. In the morning he turned round towards the dawn and when the sun
    appeared, was immediately cut down from the scaffold and fell exhausted
    upon the ground.”</p>

  <p>This act of sun worship is frequently performed, and the Sioux firmly
    believe that if they do not obey the dream which points out to them
    this duty, serious misfortunes will happen to them and their families.
    Instances have been known of men being
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span> able to endure long periods of
    torture, and young Indians, when passing through the early trials of
    their strength, will frequently remain for hours entirely suspended
    by ropes rove through their flesh. It is not possible to estimate the
    actual personal suffering thus inflicted upon themselves by these
    North American Indians, by the standard of what would be felt by more
    sensitive and more highly organised races. I have seen Chinamen endure
    with stolid indifference, tortures that would cause Europeans to feel
    the utmost agony.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

  <p>The Dakotas had another form of sun worship, which is still practised
    by some of the tribes in the West, but which appears to be chiefly
    intended as a tribal thanksgiving or rejoicing. A pole is raised in
    the centre of the encampment and upon it are placed figures of birds,
    beasts and reptiles. The Indians dance round this pole during the day
    taking <span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
    care to keep their faces towards the sun. Shortly before sunset
    the figures are shot at until they have all fallen upon the ground.
    After this there is another dance which ends when the sun sinks below
    the horizon. The ceremony is then concluded.</p>

  <p>Sickness is, with the Dakotas as with the Pawnees, considered to have
    been sent as a punishment for some wrong deed that has been committed
    either by an individual or by the tribe. I was told by Faribault that
    whenever a Sioux found that he was suffering from illness he sent for
    the medicine man,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> who, upon his arrival, would immediately proceed
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
    to ascertain what evil act the patient had done, and would then take
    the requisite measures to drive out the evil spirit representing the
    nature of the offence. It is assumed that the offence committed by
    the sick person has some reference to a man, woman or animal. The
    medicine man, who pretends to have the power of second-sight, looks
    steadily at the patient, until he declares that he can see the inner
    demon that torments him. After certain incantations, he makes out
    of clay an image of the creature which is causing the sickness, and
    then shoots at it until it is shattered. It is expected that this act
    will cause the devil to depart. If this method of cure fails, other
    images are made, as it is then assumed that more than one evil deed
    has been perpetrated. Finally, if all these remedies are unsuccessful
    it is pronounced that the patient must perform a penance. This usually
    consists of a long fast, and is considered to be a personal matter
    strictly confined to the relations that exist between the Indian and
    the Manito under whose guidance he believes himself to be, and which
    has been ascertained during the period of the great fast performed in
    his youth.</p>

  <p>It was the custom with the Sioux, whenever the head of the household
    died, for the women to mourn for a year. One of their chiefs had died
    a few years before I was at Mendota, and Faribault, who had known him
    intimately, went to the settlement to see the widow. He found her
    engaged in the occupation of cutting deep gashes in her arms and legs.
    She had, in her hand a rounded scalping knife and with this weapon
    she was striking herself and inflicting
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> wounds from which blood was
    flowing. All the furniture and mats had been removed from the tepee or
    tent, and she was sitting upon the earth. At the conclusion of the time
    of mourning it is usual for the women to go to their friends or join
    some other household, and the old tepee is then thrown down and left in
    a heap upon the ground.</p>

  <p>At the time that Faribault was speaking about these customs, there
    were present several Sioux, who had come from their encampment, and
    were listening to him. When he had finished his narrative, I took the
    opportunity of asking these men some questions about the belief of
    the Sioux, with respect to lightning and thunder, as I had heard that
    the Dakotas held some especial opinions upon these manifestations of
    supernatural power. One of the beliefs attributed to them was that
    lightning was a stone, and it was difficult to understand what could be
    their reason for holding such a strange belief. They said, in answer
    to my question, that lightning was certainly a stone, and that they
    knew it was so because they had seen it, and it was very hard and like
    a rock. Possibly the Indians had seen the fall of some aerolites, or
    they may have observed the effects of lightning after it had struck the
    earth. They state, that sometimes a small hot stone is found near the
    roots of a tree that has been injured by a flash of lightning.</p>

  <p>I asked Faribault, whether any of the tribes with whom he had
    lived, appeared to have any belief in one supreme Great Spirit. He
    replied, that, as far as he had been able to judge of this matter,
    the Sioux held this belief vaguely, but, that it did
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> not influence
    their actions. The Dakotas have a Pagan custom of investing animals,
    hills, mountains, and all remarkable natural manifestations of
    unknown powers with especial spirits of good or evil influence, each
    demanding different forms of worship and propitiation. They have
    also—under certain conditions—a belief in the transmigration of souls
    into animals. They consider that this takes place when an Indian has
    been guilty of some act of cowardice or treachery. In such a case,
    his spirit is supposed, after death, to go into some animal or to
    take its form, and then it is sometimes believed that it haunts the
    neighbourhood of the camp. The superstitious nature of the Sioux is
    often strangely affected by traditions respecting these wandering
    spirits, and when under this influence, it is said by the half-breeds
    living amongst them, that they seem to possess the power of seeing
    supernatural things.</p>

  <p>There was an instance of this mentioned as having occurred a few years
    previously. A Sioux died: it was known that he had dreamed that, after
    his death, he would enter the body of a bear, and would then wander
    round the tents of the tribe. After his death, an Indian looked out
    at daybreak, and declared that he saw upon an opposite hill a large
    grey bear. Upon hearing this rumour the tribe assembled, and many of
    the men imagined that they saw it. After this appearance there was a
    universal dread of the bear. It was frequently seen, and the Indians
    were careful to avoid meeting it. During the time that the tribe were
    encamped in this part of the country, south of the Minnesota, the bear
    was occasionally seen prowling over the hills. One
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> of the chiefs was
    asked by a white man, who was trading with this tribe, why it was not
    killed, and he was told, that it was because it contained the spirit
    of a dead brother. There was no doubt in the minds of the Indians
    about the reality of the vision. They were positive in declaring that
    they saw the bear, and would point it out to the half-breeds staying
    in the camp, who could never see it. This power of seeing what is to
    other men unseen, is stated to be possessed by many of the Dakotas, and
    is probably, in a great measure, due to a highly sensitive condition
    of mind, caused by their long periods of self-imposed abstinence.
    Faribault said, that Sioux, when travelling the country, will
    suddenly start and tremble, and point to something not visible to the
    half-breeds, and declare that they see the form of the spirit that they
    dread.</p>

  <p>The dreams and fasts of the Dakotas, and the time passed by them
    in solitude, explain much that is strange and exceptional in their
    nature. It is thus intelligible how it happens, that the young Indians
    have such an earnest and vivid belief in the spiritual nature of the
    unknown and mysterious world, and that they invest with supernatural
    attributes the mysterious powers which surround them. It must seem
    natural to them, that thunder and lightning, sun, moon, mountains, and
    rivers, should be considered as manifestations of powerful spirits,
    that require to receive worship and sacrifice. What, however, is not
    so obvious, is the cause which impels them to worship large rocks and
    stones, which cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be supposed
    to possess active powers of good or evil.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> Upon this subject I asked
    the Indians for their explanation, saying, that I supposed they did not
    directly worship a stone, such as that near Mendota, but the spirit who
    had placed it there. Faribault said, that this worship also followed
    upon dreams, and the Indians, who were present, concurred in his
    statement. It sometimes happens that a Sioux, in his dream, instead of
    seeing the image of the sun or some animal, will see nothing but one of
    these large Spirit rocks. It is thus conveyed to his mind, that this is
    his god, by which his actions and fate are to be governed during his
    life, and to whom he must offer sacrifices.</p>

  <p>The whole tribe will occasionally take part in the worship of a
    boulder.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> A dreamer, usually in this case, a man who is supposed to
    be gifted with prophetic power, dreams that it has become necessary to
    propitiate some unknown spirit. Then if he afterwards dreams of one of
    these boulders he acquaints the tribe with the nature of his dream, and
    the camp is immediately moved to the neighbourhood of the particular
    stone that is to receive sacrifices. This worship of Spirit rocks
    continues to take place. There is a large rounded mass of granite on
    the west bank of the Mississippi, lying upon the prairie a few miles
    below Lake Pepin, which is still visited by wandering bands of Sioux.
    It had been painted a bright red colour. When passing near the spot
    where it was situated, I saw the fires of the encampment of Indians who
    had come there to perform their ceremonies.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

  <p>Amongst the various superstitious customs of the Dakotas, none are
    more singular than those which are related to serpent worship, and I
    listened with attention to the opinions of the Sioux upon this subject.
    They said that with serpents, as with other animals, the sacrifices
    made to them were entirely a personal matter, depending upon the
    nature of the dreams and upon the special kind of affinity that an
    Indian might believe himself to possess with them. With regard to
    rattlesnakes the methods of propitiation varied, for it happens that
    some of the men of a tribe find that they have a power of fascination
    over these reptiles. Others are aware of a feeling of dread of them,
    and consequently act differently. Usually a snake worshipper, upon
    meeting a rattlesnake, carefully clears and smooths the ground and
    places upon it his offering. He then fills his pipe with tobacco,
    lights it and turns the mouth-piece towards the snake, holding the bowl
    in his hands. He then makes his request.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But, said the Sioux, these
    things are done in secret and very little is known about them. Each
    Indian, especially concerned, knows how and in what manner to offer his
    sacrifice.</p>

  <p>There is necessarily a difficulty in comprehending the depth or extent
    of the belief in the supernatural powers of the gods ruling over them,
    as understood and acted upon by ignorant and savage natures, such as
    the Dakotas, whose opinions have been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
    formed after they have undergone
    long periods of fasting and suffering. An event occurred in a tribe
    then dwelling near the banks of the Minnesota, which proved that these
    Indians believed that their gods took a direct part in the government
    of the world beneath them, and manifested their anger by punishing
    those men who had offended them, unless a sufficient sacrifice was made
    as a propitiation. This event was reported in the year 1852, by Mr.
    Prescott, who was residing amongst the Sioux.</p>

  <p>His letter ran as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="right">“St. Peters, <i>January</i> 26, 1852.</p>

    <p class="smcap noindent">“Sir,</p>

    <p>“I mentioned an instance of human sacrifice amongst the Sioux,
      but I did not know for what cause at the time, but since I have
      found out the cause of the sacrifice.</p>

    <p>“There came up a terrible thunder-storm. The lightning was
      flashing and falling in every direction about the Indian’s
      lodge, and the Indian thought the lightning or thunder was
      angry with him, and was about to kill him; so the Indian took
      his gun and shot his own son, and offered him as a sacrifice to
      the thunder, to save his own life.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Amongst the Indian races occupying the Northern American continent,
    the Dakotas and the Pawnees are the only tribes who are known to have
    had the custom of sacrificing human beings to their gods. It is of
    importance to remark that these two races dwelt in neighbouring lands,
    and had customs <span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
    which point to analogies with the Toltecs and Aztecs,
    in Southern Mexico, and the Mound Builders in Ohio. With the Dakotas
    human sacrifices were the greatest of the propitiations to their angry
    gods. It was known that Faribault had dwelt with a tribe of the Sioux
    upon an occasion when one of these sacrifices occurred, and I asked
    him to give me a detailed account of the proceedings that then took
    place, for cases of that serious nature rarely happen, although some
    centuries earlier, when tribal wars were frequent and perilous, it may
    be conjectured that they were numerous.</p>

  <p>Faribault said that, at the time when this human sacrifice occurred,
    he was living with a band of Sioux belonging to the Sissiton tribe,
    and they were encamped near the west shores of Lake Pepin. “They
    had come to the conclusion that, for some reason which they did not
    comprehend, a curse was upon them. Everything seemed to go wrong. Game
    was scarce and hard to kill, and there was much distress and sickness.
    Fastings and the usual sacrifices seemed to be of no avail, and nothing
    removed the evil influences which surrounded them. Finally an Indian,
    not a chief, but a man who was an orator and a prophet, had it made
    known to him by a dream what propitiation was required. This man had
    three daughters. The youngest of them was twelve years old; she was a
    beautiful child and her father’s favourite. He dreamt that, to appease
    the Great Spirit, it was necessary to sacrifice this child. In the
    morning before sunrise, he awoke the girl and told her to go out of
    the tent, wash herself and then put on her best dress and all her
    ornaments. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
    then called the tribe together and told them his dream.
    When they had heard what he declared they removed the tents to an
    adjacent camping ground and remained there until he joined them. He was
    then left alone with his daughter. He told her that in his dream he had
    seen the Great Spirit who had commanded that she should be sacrificed.
    His daughter accordingly stood up, and facing the sun, began to sing
    her death song, which was a kind of hymn. At noon, when the sun had
    risen to its highest point in the sky, he killed her.”</p>

  <p>The Sioux stated that after this sacrifice everything prospered,
    sickness ceased, game became abundant and all went well with the
    tribe.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

  <p>The burial customs of the Dakotas were, in several respects,
    distinctive. The dead were placed upon an open framework or
    scaffolding, which, when the tribes were encamped upon the prairies,
    was raised a sufficient height above the ground to be out of the reach
    of wolves. Ultimately the bones were taken to the tribal burial places.
    It is not improbable that the Mound Builders had similar usages.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

  <p>The Sacs and Foxes who dwelt on the lands near the southern borders of
    a part of the Dakota territories had different customs. Judge Williams
    told me that, when he was residing amongst them, it was their practice,
    when burying a man, to fix two upright posts. The body was placed in
    a sitting position on the surface of the ground with the back resting
    against one of the posts, and the feet touching the other. It was then
    covered over with earth.</p>

  <p>The methods followed by the Dakotas and Chippewas in curing illness by
    the use of steam appear to be of very ancient origin, and evidently are
    the same as those that were described by Clavigero as being practised
    by the Aztecs in the towns of Mexico. They are also adopted by the
    Shoshones in the deserts of Utah. Amongst the Dakotas a low circular
    wigwam is made about four feet high. The frame is usually covered
    with buffalo skins in such a manner that no steam can escape. A small
    opening is left through which the patient can crawl in. In the interior
    of the wigwam some sand is put upon the ground. Stones which have been
    heated by fire are then pushed in under the wigwam and placed upon this
    sand, together with a jar of water. The patient then pours the water
    upon the stones until the interior is filled with vapour or steam.</p>

  <p>When the Jesuit missionaries surveyed the shores of Lake Superior in
    1669, they reported that the savages in preparing their meals, used
    a pail made of birch bark, which contained water. Hot stones were
    thrown into this until the water was raised to a temperature which was
    sufficiently high to cook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
    their food. This custom was similar to
    that which was followed by the Maoris in New Zealand.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It is hazardous to attempt to form any conclusions, based upon
      analogies, respecting the habits and superstitions of savage
      races, but with regard to the Maoris and the Dakotas, there are
      circumstances which require that a passing notice should be
      given to them.</p>

    <p>The New Zealanders, like the Dakotas, placed the bodies of the
      dead upon platforms or high scaffoldings. After a certain time
      the bones were scraped and gathered together, and taken to the
      burying place.</p>

    <p>The Maoris also had much faith in dreams, and believed that it
      was chiefly through them that they received communications from
      their gods. It was also usual for widows to show their grief,
      upon the death of their husbands, by cutting themselves with
      sharp instruments.</p>

    <p>The Sandwich Islanders, who are believed to be of the same race
      as the Maoris, used, in cases of sickness, a steam bath in the
      same manner as the Dakotas.</p>

    <p>In 1878, I met a number of Maoris in the valley of the Waikato,
      in the northern island of New Zealand. The men and women
      differed from the Malay type, and resembled, in many respects,
      the North American Indians. I am of opinion, that at a remote
      period, there must have been a communication between the
      aboriginal natives of the Sandwich Islands, and the Indians
      dwelling upon the western coasts of North America.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span>In</span> the forenoon of the third day of January, the “Golden City”
    commanded by Captain Lapidge, left San Francisco for the Central and
    South American Pacific ports.</p>

  <p>We had on board, as passengers, several members of the Austrian
    mission, originally embarked in the frigate Danube under their chief
    Rear-Admiral Baron Petz, with instructions to make commercial treaties
    with China, Japan, Siam, Guatemala, Chili and other Spanish-American
    States. This part of the mission had been detached to visit Guatemala
    and it was arranged that upon the completion of their duties in Central
    America, they should rejoin the frigate in the Southern Pacific. Dr.
    Scherzer, the author of the narrative of the voyage of the Novara, and
    who had also published the journal of his travels in Central America,
    was placed in charge of this service. He was accompanied by Baron
    Herbert and Baron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
    Ransonnet, acting as secretaries. I had already met
    these members of the staff and it was a mutual pleasure to find that we
    were proceeding to the same regions.</p>

  <p>Soon after leaving the harbour we approached the rocks upon which great
    numbers of seals were seen. They watched our movements with attention,
    and in reply to the sound of the blows of our paddlewheels upon the
    water, bellowed at us defiantly.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_177"><img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="600" height="305" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">The “Golden City” passing the Seal Rocks.</div>
  </div>

  <p>We at first steered a course near the shore, but finding that there
    was a heavy ground swell, we kept about four miles out from the land,
    a distance sufficiently close to enable us to have a good view of the
    Californian hills. One night, large beacon fires were reported to be
    observed on the heights of the southern extremity of Lower California.
    The course was consequently altered towards a small bay within Cape San
    Lucas, and a boat came alongside conveying passengers. It was very dark
    and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
    signal fires threw a fitful glare upon the sea and our ship,
    at intervals. As we followed the line of the coast, the scenery became
    very grand as we approached the mountain ranges of Mexico. The weather
    was fine, the sea, rightly called Pacific, was as smooth as glass, and
    there was an effect of atmosphere which gave a marvellously beautiful
    colouring to the slopes and valleys of the mountains.</p>

  <p>Several days after our departure from San Francisco we entered the
    little land-locked harbour of Manzanillo. When rounding the point
    we disturbed several flocks of pelicans. They gathered speed with
    a few flaps of their great wings and then swept over the water
    noiselessly without further effort, altering the direction of their
    flight until they were sheltered from observation by some intervening
    rocks.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Manzanillo is one of the seaports of the city of Mexico,
    and communicates with the capital by a road leading to Colima and
    Guadelajara. Near the village there is a shallow lake called La Laguna
    de Cuyutlan, in which exist an extraordinary number of alligators.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

  <p>After our ship had anchored, some of the passengers went to look at
    this quiet reptile-infested lagoon, which is separated from the sea by
    a narrow strip of land. Captain Lapidge told us that a few years before
    our arrival, there had been a long continuance of westerly winds, and
    these together with an unusually high tide caused the sea to flow over
    the isthmus into the lagoon. Numerous alligators then came out from it
    and crossed over into the bay where they were immediately attacked by
    sharks, which abound on this part of the coast. He said that a fearful
    combat took place and for several days the bay was deluged with blood.</p>

  <p>It had become dark before we returned from the lagoon, and we passed
    through the Indian village situated near its banks. The women were busy
    grinding, on rounded granite slabs, grains of maize; or cooking various
    herbs and vegetables in small earthern pans. The interior of their huts
    contained one room. The ground was usually bare, but in some instances
    a few mats were laid down. The exterior was formed of long upright
    poles or sticks closely bound together. The roofs, which were high and
    sloped steeply downwards, were made of brushwood and palm leaves.</p>

  <p>During the night we continued our voyage near the Mexican coast, and on
    the morning of the 10th entered the harbour of Acapulco. In the crowded
    market place we saw a strange medley of races, Indians, Negroes,
    Ladinos, Mestizos, and Pintos who afforded ample occupation for the
    artistic talents of Baron Ransonnet. The Indians were of moderate
    stature and of a dark swarthy colour, their faces
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> were broad, and
    their hair was long, heavy and very black. All had peculiarly restless
    eyes. We were interested in looking at the Pintos, a numerous race of
    Indians inhabiting the hills of this part of Mexico, who are given that
    name in consequence of the coloured spots on their skin. Some of them
    were merely spotted, others had their feet or hands almost white and of
    a disagreeable livid tint. In several, the dark red skin of the face
    was completely covered with white round spots. These spots always begin
    as blue marks and develop into sores, which afterwards heal into these
    indelible white scars. The Indians say that this kind of leprosy is
    inherited. In all other respects they were perfectly healthy.</p>

  <p>At midnight on the 13th, we arrived off San José de Guatemala. Captain
    Lapidge lowered a boat and put us on board the nearest vessel, which
    we afterwards found to be a North German barque called the Gelert.
    Although the sea was smooth she was rolling heavily. The Golden City
    also gave some deep lurches, and it was difficult to get in or out of
    the boat. Baron Ransonnet left us with the intention of proceeding to
    Panama. Finally Dr. Scherzer, Baron Herbert, and myself, made the best
    of our position and slept—or endeavoured to sleep—for the rest of the
    night upon the deck of the Gelert.</p>

  <p>The view from the barque when the sun rose above the horizon, was of
    a character not to be forgotten. The great range of volcanoes which,
    commencing in the North in Alaska, runs like a backbone near the
    Pacific Coast through the entire length of the American continent to
    the southern limits of Patagonia, is here very remarkable. The
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> great
    mountains of Agua and Fuego, rising respectively over twelve and
    thirteen thousand feet above the sea, were immediately opposite to us.
    The volcano of Pacaya was on the right, and, on the left, were the
    distant volcanoes near the Lake of Atitlan.</p>

  <p>Our landing was accomplished without difficulty, and in the forenoon
    we left San José for the capital in an open carriage, with three good
    horses harnessed abreast. The road ran in a straight line through the
    forest which covered the low tropical plain, extending for a distance
    of forty miles from the sea to the base of the hills. Occasionally
    we passed the huts occupied by the mixed race descended from African
    negroes and Indians, who have been given the name of Zambos.</p>

  <p>It would be difficult to account for the existence of a race of African
    descent, dwelling near the Western coasts of the Pacific, if we did not
    possess the statements of the Spanish historians, and their explanation
    of the circumstances which necessitated the introduction of negroes for
    the purpose of working in the mines or plantations, and to take the
    place of the Indians who died in great numbers in consequence of the
    severity of their treatment by the conquerors. The features of these
    Zambos, resembled those of the aboriginal race of Indians, but the hair
    was like that of the negroes on the West coast of Africa.</p>

  <p>At the village of Masagua, we saw several Indians who had come down
    from the hills. They were men of unusually diminutive stature, all
    of them being under five feet in height, but they were well-formed,
    muscular and active. The town of Escuintla was reached after sunset,
    and towards midnight I went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
    to the Plaza to see the numerous groups of
    Indians, who were resting there for the night on their way to a church
    festival that was going to be held several days’ journey eastwards.
    The moonlight was extraordinarily brilliant, and the Indians evidently
    considered that its influence was dangerous, for they carefully avoided
    it, and sheltered themselves amongst the trees, or within the deep
    shadows cast by the walls of the church. The platform in front of the
    beautiful façade of that building, was surrounded by colonnades of palm
    trees. Beyond, but seemingly close at hand, were the gigantic forms of
    the twin volcanoes of Water and Fire.</p>

  <p>Before daybreak we arrived at the village of Amatitlan, situated on
    the borders of the lake of that name near the base of the volcano of
    Pacaya, and in the morning we saw before us the plateau upon which
    stands the city of Guatemala, five thousand feet above the sea.
    Gradually we found that we were accompanied by Indians belonging to the
    various villages near the road, who were on their way to the market
    place, carrying on their backs heavy loads of wood, crockery and
    vegetables.</p>

  <p>As we approached the gates of the city, our horses increased their
    pace, and the scene became very animated. Hundreds of Indians joined
    us from all directions, and ran by the sides of our carriage. The
    bells of the numerous churches were ringing for prayers. We passed the
    castle, the market place crowded with Indian women selling their wares,
    and the cathedral. Priests and sisters of mercy were hurrying along
    the streets; groups of soldiers carrying old-fashioned muskets, were
    lounging near their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
    barracks. Our horses became excited and broke into
    a gallop, and finally, with great noise and speed, we drove up to the
    doors of the Hotel Aleman, and were soon installed in comfortable rooms
    opening into the central court or patio, which forms such an agreeable
    feature in all well-arranged Spanish inns.</p>

  <p>Soon after our arrival Colonel Miguel Garcia y Granados, one of the
    Government officials, called upon Dr. Scherzer and gave us a vivid
    report of the political condition of the Republic. The Indians of the
    provinces between Guatemala and the Mexican frontier were in rebellion.
    A large force of them under the leadership of an Indian, named
    Serapio Cruz, were marching towards the city, and a battle between
    them and the Government troops was imminent. He also mentioned some
    interesting facts with respect to the late President Carrera. Carrera
    was a remarkable instance of native capacity. He was an uneducated
    Indian of obscure birth who, by sheer force of character, energy, and
    courage, was, at an early age, placed at the head of large bodies of
    Indians during the various revolutionary outbreaks which succeeded the
    declaration of Independence from Spain. Finally he became President of
    the Republic and governed the people with such obstinate determination
    and firmness of will that, in a few years, he was able to place the
    whole country under a steady system of control. In doing this he was
    assisted by the fact of being an Indian and having, consequently, great
    personal influence over the natives. He also received the support of
    the priests for, like all Indians, he was extremely fanatical.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

  <p>Colonel Garcia told us that Carrera always had on his writing table
    a toy representing Louis Philippe with his hat in his hand. This toy
    had a rounded base and was so weighted that, when it was touched, it
    rolled backwards and forwards, and would thus represent Louis Philippe
    constantly bowing hat in hand. Carrera when engaged at his official
    work would frequently make the toy move, and then would say to those
    that stood near him “It was in that way, by too much bowing, that
    Louis Philippe lost his throne, I shall take care that I do not make
    the same mistake.” Carrera was not only supported by the priests, but
    also by the Spaniards, who knew that he alone could keep the Indians in
    subjection. Latterly he spoke much of the Indian chief Cruz, and said
    that he was the only man in the State who was to be feared.</p>

  <p>During our residence in Guatemala, I was fortunate in having the
    acquaintance of Don Francisco Gavarrete, who held a post under the
    Government and was well informed upon all subjects relating to
    the Indians. He was also, I understood, the proprietor of some of
    the lands within which were the sculptured monoliths and idols of
    Quirigua. At the Museum in the city there was a good collection of
    Indian antiquities which had been found within the territories of
    the Republic, including several idols from Copan and Santa Cruz del
    Quiché. When examining these I was accompanied by him and he directed
    my attention to certain objects of importance. Many of them were well
    carved and it was clear that the sculptors were able to work and shape
    the hardest stone with accuracy and skill.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

  <p>There was a small idol, made of hard green stone, which had been
    found hidden behind the high altar of a church near the town of
    Gueguetenango. Dr. Scherzer, who during his travels in Central America,
    had learnt much about the religious customs of the natives, told us
    that the priest of a church situated amongst the hills near Atitlan
    had noticed an Indian girl, who was one of his parishioners, showing
    an unusual fervour in her devotions, and he tried to find out the
    cause. He, at last, discovered that she had buried an idol in the
    ground close behind the church beyond the altar, so that although she
    appeared to be praying to what was before her in the church, she was
    actually addressing her requests to the idol outside. This priest
    considered that his Indians were by nature idolaters and that it was
    not practicable to prevent them from returning to their ancient habits.
    Señor Gavarrete said that in the Department of Vera-Paz the Indians
    had still the custom of erecting somewhere near the churches small
    idol-houses in which they kept the image of a saint. To this they
    offered sacrifices of meats and flowers, and at certain seasons they
    were accustomed to keep watch or guard at the door throughout the night.</p>

  <p>It is more than strange that nothing has been discovered in the course
    of the explorations of the various ancient sites in this part of the
    continent, which throws any light upon the methods employed by the
    Indians, for the purpose of carving and shaping granite, green marble,
    and hard lava. No mason’s implement of any kind has been found. A
    few copper chisels appear to have been used for some purpose which
    is unknown. They could not apparently
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>have been of much service in
    working stone, for the edges were rounded and the metal was soft. This
    question as to the system adopted by the Indian sculptors in producing
    such excellent work, is as inexplicable now as it was to the Spaniards
    in the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>Señor Gavarrete asked me to accept a fine obsidian spear head which had
    been found amongst the ruins of Quirigua. This black volcanic glass is
    admirably adapted for cutting and wounding purposes. I had previously
    picked up in an ancient earthwork outside the city, several fragments
    of the same substance, which had evidently been placed on the edges of
    wooden daggers or swords which inflicted jagged and dangerous wounds.
    Obsidian knives were used by the Aztec priests when offering human
    sacrifices to their gods. The spear head was in form and in the method
    followed for chipping the mineral into the requisite shape, similar to
    the large arrow heads made by the Indians in the western parts of North
    America, where obsidian is obtained near the volcanic ranges of the
    Sierra Nevada.</p>

  <p>During the latter part of the month numerous groups of Indians passed
    through the city on their return from the pilgrimage to Esquipulas.
    The festival of the church at that place occurs annually on the 15th
    of January. It is estimated that upon an average over eighty thousand
    Indians are present upon that occasion. Esquipulas became an important
    shrine in consequence of a wooden crucifix, black from age, having
    been found buried in the ground near that town. It was supposed by
    the Spaniards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
    that it must have been lost by one of their missionary
    priests when passing through that part of the province at some early
    period soon after the conquest. This black crucifix was placed in the
    sanctuary, and from some cause which has not been ascertained, it was
    soon held in the highest veneration by the natives.</p>

  <p>Indians assembled there in great numbers from all parts of the country,
    and travelled great distances in order to be present at the festival,
    and to take part in the performance of the religious ceremonies.</p>

  <p>At the Cathedral in Guatemala we frequently saw the pilgrims kneeling
    before the shrines and showing much devotional respect to certain
    images. These natives were invariably grown up men and women.
    They journeyed on foot, carrying with them their provisions and
    water-gourds. They seemed to be desirous of avoiding all contact or
    conversation with others. Their conduct was quiet and unobtrusive.
    It was their custom to pass silently through the city. At the doors
    of each church they stopped for a few moments, and then entered and
    knelt before the altar. After the completion of these acts of worship,
    they proceeded on their journey across the plains towards the huts and
    villages scattered over the slopes of the distant hills. They never
    halted in the street, or took any part in the daily movements of the
    inhabitants.</p>

  <p>The pilgrimage is also undertaken by Indians from the distant regions
    of Central America. Many of them traverse hundreds of miles. There is
    something in the devotional nature of these ignorant aboriginal people
    which escapes the comprehension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
    of those who observe them. I noticed
    that the Indians varied considerably in stature and complexion. The men
    who dwelt among the Cordilleras seemed to be of a finer race than those
    who were settled on the plains, and were much darker in the colour of
    their skin.</p>

  <p>The most attractive spot in the city was the market place. Within the
    square, crowds of people, Indians and Ladinos, were daily assembled,
    all of them buying, selling and carrying on the ordinary traffic, with
    a silence and listless indifference which was in strong contrast with
    the life and animation of the cities in the United States. It was a
    constant pleasure to observe the movements of the younger Indian women,
    who in their appearance and demeanour, were far superior to the men.
    This difference arises from their habits and employment. The women
    have a certain kind of dignity in their manner, caused, in a great
    measure, by their usage of carrying water jars and pans of crockery
    poised upon their heads. They therefore walk slowly and hold themselves
    upright. This custom which begins from early childhood, and forms part
    of their daily life, has the result of giving them good figures and a
    particularly graceful movement.</p>

  <p>The men, on the contrary, have a crouching appearance, caused by the
    method in which they have been accustomed, from boyhood, to carry
    their burdens. They relieve the pressure of the weight on their
    backs by means of a broad band passed over the forehead and thus,
    by bending forward, the load is made less oppressive. The men and
    boys consequently contract a stooping posture, and this presents
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
    an unfavourable contrast to the women, whose bearing is precisely
    the reverse. There is another circumstance which has its influence
    in shaping the figures of the women. They carry all small things on
    the open palm of the left hand, which is thrown back and held well
    raised up. In fact the same causes which affect the appearance of the
    Indians in North America are present here, but with the difference
    that there it is the squaw who contracts the stooping and bent figure,
    through carrying her children and other burdens, and it is the man who
    maintains the upright figure and dignified manner.</p>

  <p>On the plains a few miles to the west of the city, in the direction of
    the village of Mixco, there is a large and extensive group of ancient
    Indian mounds of whose construction or purpose nothing is known. They
    have never been scientifically examined and I was not able to ascertain
    that any plans had been made of them. No author has alluded to them
    unless by a mere passing notice, and yet they seemed to throw more
    light upon the question of the Toltecan or Aztecan migrations than any
    other remains of ancient antiquities. Possibly no previous traveller in
    this part of Central America had also seen the mounds of Cahokia, near
    the eastern banks of the Mississippi, or he could hardly have failed to
    have observed that their resemblance is so great, and indeed so evident
    as to place it almost beyond doubt, that the builders of the mounds
    at Cahokia were of the same race as those that dwelt on the plains of
    Mixco.</p>

  <p>As it would be highly improbable that any nation would migrate from
    lands abounding with means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
    food, comfort and warmth to what must
    have been, at that period, the comparatively inhospitable regions of
    North America, the tribes that constructed these mounds must have
    originally migrated from the valley of the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>I was employed for several days in making a rough survey of this Indian
    settlement and took measurements of the inclosure. The ground plan was
    made in the form of an extensive and irregular parallelogram about
    twelve hundred yards long and five hundred yards wide. The mounds upon
    the sides of the greatest length vary in their dimensions. Some of them
    are very large and exceed forty-five feet in height. The most important
    are those platform earthworks at each end of the inclosure upon which
    may have been placed the principal communal buildings, or the houses of
    the Caciques. There was also a mound of an exceptional shape, situated
    in the interior which, from its position, may have been intended for
    purposes similar to those that existed within the embankments of Fort
    Ancient in Ohio.</p>

  <p>When Carrera was President of Guatemala he wished to know for what
    object these mounds were built, and he therefore gave orders that
    one of the largest of them should be thoroughly examined. It was
    ascertained, contrary to expectation, that it was not a burial place.
    The only thing found in it was a large and well carved granite
    grindstone of the same shape as those at present used by the Indians
    for grinding maize. The results of Carrera’s excavations appeared
    to establish the conclusion that the mounds were chiefly raised for
    the purpose of placing dwellings upon them; and this is also, I was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
    informed, the opinion of the natives living in the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile from day to day the capital had been disturbed by
    rumours of the movements of the advancing insurgents, and it was
    difficult to make any decided plans with regard to my journey in the
    interior. It was considered by the Government authorities that it would
    be highly imprudent for me to attempt to pass through the disturbed
    provinces, as the natives were known to have become unsettled and
    excited. It was therefore with great satisfaction that I heard that the
    Indians were coming near and that a decisive battle was imminent. The
    President Don Vincente Cerna had taken all proper precautions, and had
    placed the troops under the command of his most able officer, General
    Solares.</p>

  <p>On the twenty-third of January we were informed that the rebels were
    approaching, and that an action between the forces was expected to
    take place immediately. Baron Herbert and myself then went into the
    adjoining country with the hope of obtaining a distant view of the
    operations. In the afternoon we heard the firing of guns from the
    castle announcing to the people that the Indians were defeated, and,
    to prevent there being any doubts upon the subject, messengers arrived
    from General Solares bringing with them the head of his opponent. This
    practical method of assuring the inhabitants of the success of the
    Government troops had a good effect. It was afterwards made known that
    the Indians had been surrounded at an early hour and taken by surprise
    whilst they were amongst the ravines. Serapio Cruz fought desperately
    but was killed and decapitated.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

  <p>Thus ended the Indian rebellion, and a period of considerable local
    anxiety. A political revolution is an event which may be expected to
    occur frequently in Spanish-American republics, but a rising of Indians
    in rebellion or, as it is called, a “Guerra de Castas” (war of races),
    is a far more serious matter, as was proved by the occurrences that
    happened at the time of the revolt of the Indians in Yucatan, in 1847,
    when their war cry was “Death to all Spaniards.”</p>

  <p>At a dinner given at the English legation upon the evening of the
    conclusion of the insurrection, the subject of the state of the
    Guatemalan provinces was considered, with reference to the expediency
    of my intention to travel alone through the disturbed districts.
    Many of the members of the foreign legations were present.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It
    was thought that the Indian population near the Mexican frontier
    and amongst the remote parts of the Cordilleras would be, for some
    time, in a restless and excitable condition, and might be inclined
    to show their revenge for what had lately happened, by killing any
    white man who should attempt to pass through the country or who
    should by misadventure fall into their power. I was however informed
    by a Spaniard who understood the character of the native races
    that, although <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
    this opinion was true with respect to Spaniards, an
    Englishman would probably travel over the Cordilleras with safety. I
    accordingly lost no time in completing my preparations for the journey.</p>

  <p>There was a difficulty in obtaining a good ambling mule, without which
    long rides over a rugged country would be necessarily fatiguing.
    Fortunately the Duke de Licignano, who was residing in Guatemala,
    was willing to part with one of his trained mules, and it was with
    great satisfaction that I saw this well-bred animal brought into the
    courtyard of the inn, and placed under the care of my guide.</p>

  <p>I received from the Government an official passport or letter of
    recommendation to the Corregidors under their jurisdiction, which I
    hoped would be of service as far as the frontier.</p>

  <p>Mexico was reported to be temporarily in a lawless condition, but
    I expected to find upon my arrival within its boundaries, that the
    authority of the republic was sufficiently established to enable me to
    proceed without any serious obstacles to the ruins of Palenque.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> daybreak on the thirtieth day of January, my Indian guide Anastasio,
    reported that the mules were ready. He had filled the saddle bags with
    a good supply of provisions, together with a store of native chocolate,
    and had otherwise made due arrangements for the mules in the event of
    any mischance happening to them. We then proceeded on our way to the
    town of La Antigua Guatemala. Baron Herbert came with us for several
    miles, and Mr. Hague proposed to accompany me for a day’s journey and
    see me safely started on my road.</p>

  <p>When we came near the Indian mounds, I halted for a short time to take
    a sketch of them from some rising ground whence a good view could be
    obtained. On the left rose the Volcan de Agua. In the distance could
    be seen the village of Mixco, and on the right were the Sierras,
    stretching far away towards the North, looking well defined in the
    clear atmosphere of a bright and sunny morning.</p>

  <p>At Mixco we stopped for breakfast, and were
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> joined by the cura of the
    parish, who was an agreeable and well-informed man. Mixco is especially
    interesting to Englishmen on account of its having been the curacy
    of our fellow countryman, Thomas Gage.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> He was appointed there in
    December, 1629, and had the charge of this and some adjacent parishes
    for about seven years. He then left Guatemala and returned to England.
    Beyond the village we obtained a view of the Lake Amatitlan. We then
    passed San Lucas, and reached La Antigua Guatemala in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>Upon our arrival we called upon Padre Martinez, and asked him to show
    us the ancient cathedral. It was in a ruined condition, and at the
    time of our visit the nave and aisles were occupied by cattle. In the
    centre of the roof we observed the emblem of the imperial arms of
    Austria, the double-headed eagle, which fixed the date of the erection
    of the building as being in the reign of the Emperor Charles V. There
    still remained within the shrines many fine wood carvings, and it
    could be seen that the ornamentation of the interior must have been in
    accordance with the artistic abilities of the Spanish architects of
    that period. After leaving this fine example of one of the earliest
    churches in Central America, we looked at the ruins of the palace
    and government buildings. It was evident that the ancient Guatemala,
    before it was destroyed by earthquakes, must have well deserved its
    reputation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
    of being, next to Mexico, the most flourishing city in the
    New World.</p>

  <p>Close at hand and dominating the ruins, are the lofty twin volcanoes
    of Agua and Fuego (Water and Fire). The former in 1541, caused the
    destruction of the first town established by the Spaniards, which
    is now called La Vieja Guatemala. The manner in which that capital
    was overwhelmed and destroyed, was so exceptional, that it is
    desirable that the events which then occurred should be brought into
    consideration.</p>

  <p>It was stated by a Spanish resident who was present on that occasion,
    that although the rainfall had been abundant during the year, there
    was nothing in the other atmospheric conditions to give any reason for
    anxiety. But on the 10th of Sept., 1541, two hours after sunset, a
    mass of water suddenly issued from the crater of the nearest volcano,
    and rushing down the slope of the mountain with great velocity,
    immediately swept away the greater part of the town. This inundation
    was accompanied by the shock of an earthquake. During the night the
    disasters caused by the rapid waters are described as having been
    terrible. The torrents, with which were mingled masses of detached
    rocks and the trunks of uprooted trees, carried away everything before
    them. Amongst those who perished was Doña Beatriz de la Cueva, the
    widow of Alvarado, the conqueror of these southern provinces.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

  <p>The Spanish inhabitants formed the belief that this unusual disaster
    must have been caused by movements of a miraculous nature, and that the
    eruption of a volcano throwing out floods of water was a punishment
    inflicted upon them on account of their sins. They thought that evil
    spirits had been permitted to cast loose upon them the penalties of
    fire, water and earthquake. Bernal Diaz who a few years afterwards
    resided at La Antigua Guatemala, gives in his History of the Conquest a
    vivid but imaginative description of the horrors of that night, based
    upon statements made by the bishop of the diocese. He reports that
    during the tempest great stones were rolled down the mountain and into
    the city by numbers of demons (<span xml:lang="es">muchos demonios</span>,) and that many people
    heard shouts, yells, and voices, and saw two monstrous black men moving
    in the rolling waters, calling out, “Forsake everything, for the end of
    all things is at hand.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

  <p>Various theories have been suggested in explanation of this outburst
    of water from the volcano. It is supposed that the crater may have
    contained a large volume of water, which after the excessive rainfall
    of the year exerted such pressure as to burst open the inclosing
    sides and that the contents were suddenly set free. If this theory is
    accepted as being correct, it must be granted that the interior of the
    crater was sufficiently compact to enable it to be water-tight, and
    consequently <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
    capable of becoming a small reservoir or lake. It is
    possible that the Volcan de Agua may have been for a long time extinct,
    and that consequently the sides of the interior of the crater gradually
    became impermeable. Under ordinary circumstances the materials of which
    volcanic cones are formed, would not be capable of retaining great
    quantities of water.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

  <p>I believe that the destruction of La Vieja Guatemala by the action of a
    vast torrent of water issuing from a volcano is the only instance that
    is known of such an extraordinary event, and it can be well understood
    how it happened that the superstitious residents in that capital felt
    assured that such a catastrophe must have been the work of demons and
    the powers of darkness. The second city was placed in a position where
    there was less liability to injury from any eruption, but it suffered
    so constantly from the shocks of numerous and successive earthquakes,
    that it was abandoned after having been occupied for more than two
    centuries. The present capital was established in 1775.</p>

  <p>The Volcan de Fuego is still occasionally active, and not many years
    before I passed near it, flames and dense volumes of smoke were
    reported to have come out of the crater, but no serious eruptions have
    taken place in this century. In the last century several occurred, and
    upon one occasion the city was enveloped in complete darkness during
    the greater part of the day. At the present time the volcanoes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>look
    down upon the ruined cities with grandeur and repose.</p>

  <p>On the morning of our departure from La Antigua Guatemala, we rode
    through the Plaza and passed near to the ancient palace of the Spanish
    governors, the public buildings, and the cathedral. All these ruins
    looked beautiful in the clear light of dawn.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_200"><img src="images/i_200.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">Volcan de Agua.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Volcan de Fuego.</div>
  </div>

  <p>As the sun rose we began to ascend the hills. When we reached the
    summit I stopped for a few minutes for the purpose of observing,
    towards the south, the lofty cones of Agua and Fuego whose graceful
    outlines were clear and distinct in the atmosphere of a deep blue
    tropical sky. In the forenoon we reached Chimaltenango, which was once
    a place of importance but is now becoming deserted. Beyond this town we
    followed a track leading to the village of Comolapa, and had to descend
    an abrupt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
    and deep ravine, which crossed that part of the country.
    We then rode up a long hill and passed near several groups of oak
    trees, whose leafless branches were made gay by clusters of brilliantly
    coloured orchids.</p>

  <p>Upon arriving at Comolapa, I obtained a room in a little inn, where
    we arranged to remain for the night, having already accomplished a
    distance of nine leagues. The parish priest, Padre Rodriguez, proposed
    that I should join him at supper, at which meal there also appeared a
    Mexican, travelling on his way to Guatemala from the frontier, and who
    was able to give me some useful intelligence about the roads and the
    political state of the country in the province of Chiapas. The Padre
    spoke with earnestness about the difficulties he had to overcome with
    regard to the teaching of the Catholic doctrines. He said that there
    were more than two thousand Indians under his charge. They attended
    church as a custom, and seemed to take part in the services, yet, he
    was certain that in their hearts they retained a faith in their ancient
    worship, and that they had shrines concealed amongst the mountains
    where they kept their idols. He had also found, by experience, that
    there was the greatest repugnance amongst them to all attempts at
    education, and no children would attend school after they were seven or
    eight years old.</p>

  <p>We looked at the interior of the church. Some of the wood carvings
    at the altars were well designed and executed. Over the western
    porch there was a large coat-of-arms, with lions as supporters. In
    this district a great number of the Mexican allies,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> who accompanied
    Alvarado in the conquest of Guatemala, were given lands, and many of
    them, during the early periods of the Spanish occupation, were men of
    considerable wealth; but their descendants and their families have now
    disappeared or have become merged into the aboriginal population.</p>

  <p>On the following morning we proceeded on our journey to Patinamit. We
    passed a high mound, situated near the path, which in shape was like
    that of Grave Creek, in Virginia; but it was not so large. Its height
    was about fifty-five feet. Augustin proposed that we should take a
    short cut, in consequence of which we lost our way, lengthened the
    ride by over two leagues, and had to descend and ascend a profound and
    precipitous barranca. On the sides of the track we saw many ferns, and
    passed clumps of mountain firs and other trees belonging naturally to
    high altitudes. We were riding over a country at an average height of
    seven thousand feet, and following steep and rough tracks, which tried
    the prudence of our sure-footed mules to the utmost. At noon we reached
    Tepan Guatemala, and were received at the convent by Padre Viatoro.
    The remainder of the day was passed in examining the ruins of ancient
    Patinamit, the chief city of the Kachiquels, a tribe of the same race
    as the Quichés.</p>

  <p>Patinamit is placed upon the summit of a height separated from the rest
    of the world by a steep ravine, which, except at one narrow point, so
    completely encircles it as to make it practically a kind of detached
    island. The site resembles that of Fort Ancient, and the earthworks
    are nearly as large as those upon that great fortified hill. It is
    supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
    that the palaces and temples of the Kachiquels were built
    upon this plateau, but nothing of them can now be traced. There are a
    few mounds from ten to thirty feet high, and there are several heaps
    of large loose stones, evidently taken from the ravine. The position
    must have been exclusively chosen for the purposes of defence, for
    it is almost impregnable to assault. The surrounding barranca is, in
    several places, perpendicular for a depth of over two hundred feet. The
    slopes are composed of a firm volcanic substance, consisting chiefly of
    pumice, pozzolana, ashes and stones.</p>

  <p>It has been stated<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> that, in Patinamit there was, during the rule
    of the Kachiquels, a small building, in which was kept a kind of stand
    formed of a substance resembling glass. The judges sat round this
    building and heard the causes brought before them. In the ravine below
    there was a black transparent stone, in looking into which, could be
    seen the representation of the punishment to be awarded. It was also
    consulted in time of war. Upon my return to the convent, I asked the
    padre if he knew anything about this stone, which might have been an
    unusually large fragment of obsidian, such as would have been found in
    this region, formed of matter thrown out from the craters of volcanoes.
    He said that he had never seen it, and did not know whether it still
    existed. He wished me to understand that he did not take any interest
    in the past history of the parish, but devoted his attention to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>his
    work amongst the numerous Indians placed under his care.</p>

  <p>Upon the morning of our departure, whilst the guide was saddling the
    mules, I went out to the platform in front of the convent walls, to
    look at the wide and distant views which it commanded. This outer court
    was placed well above the ground. On the top of the steps which led
    up to the platform, stood Padre Viatoro, dressed in his robes, and
    receiving the homage of his Indian parishioners as they passed beneath
    him on their way to their daily work. I had already become aware that
    the influence of priests of the Dominican Order was exceptionally great
    amongst the Indian tribes in the Cordilleras, but I had not hitherto
    observed the actual evidence of their personal power over the minds of
    the aboriginal race. The events that were taking place before me, were
    extremely strange and characteristic. Each of the Indians, as he went
    by, bowed down towards the earth, and waited to receive a blessing.
    Several women who had requests to make, knelt and remained in that
    posture. All of these meek, simple and ignorant natives seemed to look
    upon their priest as a being of a far superior nature to themselves,
    and Padre Viatoro by his imperious manner, did not permit them to
    suppose that he could be approached otherwise than with the greatest
    respect and deference.</p>

  <p>As we proceeded on our journey, I stopped my mule in order to take
    a final glance at the convent, and saw the tall erect figure of the
    Dominican sharply defined against the sky, whilst men, women and
    children were still passing before him. In the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> far distance were the
    ranges of the Cordilleras, and close at hand was the great stronghold
    of the Kachiquel conquerors, who, many centuries earlier, held the
    ancestors of this submissive race under their subjection and cruel
    tyranny. It was a scene in all respects so remarkable, that it remains
    fixed upon the memory.</p>

  <p>Our path to the hamlet of Las Godinas led over hills and plains, until
    we arrived at the edge of a barranca which we had some difficulty in
    crossing. This great chasm was about one mile wide at the top, and
    was more than a thousand feet deep; it crossed the level country for
    several miles. The sides were almost perpendicular for the first three
    hundred feet of descent, and then sloped sharply downwards. Our path
    was narrow and, in the places where it curved round the projecting
    precipitous banks, looked dangerous, but the mules went forward without
    hesitation. As it seemed to be unadvisable to attempt to guide my mule,
    I adopted the plan which I thought to be the most safe, and dropped the
    bridle over her neck, and she was thus left free to choose the road. I
    soon found by experience, that complete confidence could be placed in
    her wise and cautious judgment.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching the bottom we rode for some distance up the valley, and
    then ascended to the level of the plain. After a short ride across the
    open country we came to another equally steep barranca which had to be
    crossed. This chasm I estimated to be nearly twelve hundred feet deep.
    The sides were composed of volcanic ash, pozzolana and blocks of lava.
    The nature of the violent influences <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
    that must have been at work in
    the production of the ravines, which have thus separated these plateaux
    has yet to be fully investigated. With regard to the theory that they
    were caused by earthquakes, it may be observed that those around Tepan
    Guatemala must be approximately twenty miles from the nearest volcano.</p>

  <p>At noon we reached Las Godinas and halted at a rancho to get breakfast,
    and to give our mules a feed of sacate, which is an excellent and
    nutritious fodder composed of the stalks of maize. At this hamlet
    were assembled a large number of Indians who had come there from the
    adjoining highlands. The men were in many respects like the North
    American Indians. They were of a deep copper colour, and had black
    hair, and large, well shaped noses, broad faces and peculiarly long
    upper lips. Their eyes were round, black, furtive and restless. They
    belonged to the Kachiquel tribe, and spoke a dialect of the Quiché
    language.</p>

  <p>After a few hours’ rest we proceeded. Suddenly we opened upon a
    magnificent view. Two thousand feet below us was the great Lake of
    Atitlan, five thousand feet above the sea. It was a bright, calm, sunny
    afternoon, and the still waters, reflecting the colour of the sky, were
    as blue as a sapphire. On the opposite shore, overlooking the lake, was
    the Volcano of Atitlan, eleven thousand, eight hundred feet high, and
    beyond was a continuous chain of volcanoes stretching westwards towards
    Quezaltenango. As we descended the hills the points of view kept
    changing. It would be difficult to surpass these marvellously beautiful
    combinations of lake and volcanic mountain scenery.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

  <p>In the afternoon we reached Panajachel, and after having found a place
    of shelter for the mules, I asked the way to the house of a lady to
    whom I had a letter of introduction. The envelope bore the address of
    Doña Aña Gertrudio Leon de Montalban. I was told that I should find
    her at home, and that I was to make inquiries at the small grocer’s
    shop in the main street. Accordingly I went to the shop and asked the
    old woman behind the counter, who was at the time employed in selling
    tallow candles, if she could kindly tell me where Doña Aña de Montalban
    was to be found. She said “Señor, permit me to look at the letter,” and
    putting on her spectacles, she gazed at the envelope, opened it and
    slowly read what was inside. After having grasped the meaning of the
    writing, she smiled and said—“I am Doña Aña and this letter is written
    by a very good friend of mine, and Señor, my house is very much at
    your service; if you will wait for a few minutes until I have closed
    the shop, I will give you a room, the cook shall prepare a supper this
    evening, and I hope you will make yourself as comfortable as the poor
    means at my disposal will permit.”</p>

  <p>Panajachel was crowded with Indians. It was the day of the festival
    of the Patron Saint of an adjacent church, and they had all been to
    there present offerings and light their candles at the shrines. In
    the evening numerous Indian women dressed in white passed through the
    village, carrying candles home to place before the altar of their own
    house idol.</p>

  <p>The cura of the district, Padre Pedro, asked me
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> to join him, after his
    duties were concluded, and talk about the events of the day. The Padre
    was evidently a capable and zealous priest. He had the reputation of
    having studied the character and language of his Indian congregations,
    and of being acquainted with their habits and traditions. I was
    therefore glad to have an opportunity of obtaining from such a good
    authority some well-founded information respecting the reports of
    sacrifices to the lake and volcano.</p>

  <p>Father Pedro said that the ancient custom of sacrificing maidens at
    Atitlan, was also followed at the mountain near Quezaltenango. Whenever
    the rumbling noises were heard, threatening an eruption, a maiden
    was offered as a sacrifice to the angry god by throwing her into the
    crater. There used also to be performed some sacrificial ceremonies
    connected with the worship of the goddess of the lake, but he did not
    know what were the customs upon those occasions. The Abbé Brasseur de
    Bourbourg relates, in his notes of a journey through S. Salvador, that
    the lake of Xilopango was originally consecrated to the goddess of
    water, and that in each year, when the maize was about to ripen, four
    young girls were sacrificed.</p>

  <p>It was reported that, in some remote districts, sacrifices were still
    offered, but this is very doubtful. The Padre observed that the
    Indians at Panajachel, and in the villages bordering on the lake were
    excessively superstitious. In their houses or huts they usually had
    a room or space set apart for the abode of their saint’s image. This
    image would sometimes be carried to the parish church and be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> left
    there for a time, and then would be taken back to the house again with
    ceremonies and lighted candles. I mentioned to the Padre how I had
    noticed that the Indian women here had a habit of talking together in a
    low tone. He said this was chiefly owing to the dialect of the Quiché
    language which was spoken in this district, in which many of the sounds
    were expressed like a whisper.</p>

  <p>At daybreak Augustin was at the door with the mules, and my kind
    hostess prepared for me a cup of chocolate which she said would
    fortify me for the journey. We then left for Sololá, and soon were
    watching a glorious sunrise. The lake of Atitlan is irregular in its
    shape. According to my travelling map it has a circumference exceeding
    thirty miles. The most remarkable features are its great depth, and
    the almost perpendicular cliffs on the northern side which seem to be
    of volcanic formation. The deep blue of its waters is possibly owing
    to their depth, and the rarefied state of the atmosphere at this
    altitude. Our road led us through several villages containing chiefly
    Indian populations, and then we ascended a long and abrupt hill. As
    the day advanced we were joined by bands of Indians with cargo mules,
    travelling to the market.</p>

  <p>Sololá is the chief town of the Department, and the Corregidor was good
    enough to add some recommendations to my government letter. We stopped
    there long enough to rest the mules, and then proceeded on our way to
    San Tomas, eight leagues distant. Upon reaching the upper slopes of
    the hill I dismounted, in order to visit some Indian farm buildings
    that occupied several acres of rising
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> ground near our path. Although
    there were evidences of what may be called comparative wealth, these
    Indians—like all others that I had seen—only possessed a single hut
    with one large room in it. Men, women and lads were all busy; the boys
    cleaning and spinning wool for their black ponchos or cloaks, and the
    women, as usual, engaged in grinding maize and making tortillas.</p>

  <p>We followed a steep ascent. The path was cut into broad steps, up which
    my excellent mule clambered with the utmost ease and rapidity, and in
    a manner which brought back to the memory many rides amongst the Druse
    villages in the mountains of the Lebanon. Upon reaching the summit of
    the sierra, I turned the mule’s head round to enable me to look at the
    lake and the group of volcanoes beyond it. It was then a scene of great
    beauty, but at some remote period in the world’s history, it must have
    been a centre of great volcanic violence and devastation.</p>

  <p>Our track led, in an almost straight direction, over hills and across
    valleys, maintaining an average altitude of about seven thousand feet.
    In this region orchids were numerous. On the edge of one of the lofty
    plateaux overlooking a narrow valley, I stopped to look at and sketch a
    tall wide-spreading pine, upon whose branches these plants were growing
    with the utmost luxuriance. The orchids in this part of Guatemala are
    constant to a certain altitude which, as nearly as can be estimated, is
    about six thousand five hundred feet. They exclusively prefer to dwell
    upon the branches of oaks and pines, and always cling to such as are
    strong and full-grown.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

  <p>The manner of their habits in selecting the trees upon which they
    desired to settle, was eccentric. Thus, with respect to the pines,
    they chose those that had broad, spreading branches, and avoided those
    whose branches grew upwards. They adopted the same rule with the
    oaks. In no instance did I see orchids growing upon any trees except
    oaks and pines; all others were left bare. But even when the groups
    seemed to be all well suited for their purpose, they would select
    certain favourites, and upon the branches of these they would abound,
    giving life and colour to them, and leaving the neglected trees dark
    and gloomy by contrast. The majority of the orchids were green, but
    sometimes they were of a bright rose colour, and these when seen, as
    we then saw them, clearly defined against a deep blue sky, gave a
    brilliant colouring to the foreground. They added much to the pleasure
    of our day’s ride. They were gay, capricious and beautiful.</p>

  <p>San Tomas stands high and commands wide and extensive views of the
    sierras. Upon reaching the plateau we rode through the village, and
    finally stopped at the gate of the convent within whose walls we were
    received by Padre Hernandez. He afterwards proposed that I should look
    at his church and the altars.</p>

  <p>There was much in the interior that had a special interest, in relation
    to the obscure subject of the ancient faith of the Quichés, the great
    tribe that possessed the dominant power in this part of Central America
    at the time of the Spanish Conquest, and whose descendants are believed
    to dwell in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
    secluded part of the country. There was no religious
    service taking place or about to be held, and there was nobody present
    within or without; but the nave and chapels were illuminated with
    numbers of candles. The church was large and there were several side
    altars. In front of each of them rows of lights had been placed. Down
    the length of the nave there was a long thick block of wood in which
    were fitted sockets for holding candles. There were also quantities
    of offerings placed before each image, or whatever emblem the Indians
    chose to worship.</p>

  <p>“For in these matters,” said the Father, “I do not interfere, and in
    fact, I have no power or authority whatever within my own church. The
    Indians come and go as they please, light their candles, hold their own
    services before the altar, and frequently take one of the saints out of
    the church, and carry it away to some hut where, for several days, they
    will perform musical ceremonies before it, and then the saint will be
    brought back to its proper altar.”</p>

  <p>Padre Hernandez, although he had lived many years with these Indians,
    had not been able to obtain the slightest positive knowledge of what
    they really believed. All that he knew about the subject was, that they
    were very superstitious and devotional. He said that in many cases in
    the sierras, they had their places of worship where they kept idols,
    and at certain seasons of the year went to make offerings, and also to
    sacrifice animals to them.</p>

  <p>After a stroll through the village, I went to the Plaza, in the centre
    of which were assembled the Alcaldes and other parish dignitaries. They
    were sitting round a wood fire, discussing some urgent
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> matters of
    local interest. As I had not hitherto stopped in a populous district or
    village entirely peopled by Indians, and controlled by native Alcaldes,
    I decided to join the group. I received an Indian welcome from these
    Quichés, by not being noticed and was given a place in the circle in
    silence. I soon became interested in listening to their extremely harsh
    and guttural language, and in observing the types of the men, all of
    whom were Indians of leading families.</p>

  <p>It was a fine night. The new moon was low in the horizon. The planet
    Venus was just beneath it, and immediately above was Jupiter, a rare
    and beautiful conjunction, looking bright and sharply defined in the
    clear atmosphere of this elevated table land.</p>

  <p>When the discussion came to an end I left the Alcaldes engaged in
    toasting tortillas over the embers of the fire, and returned to my
    host at the convent. It had been the fate of Padre Hernandez to have
    passed the best years of his life in the vain endeavour to get these
    Indians to understand the tenets of his faith, but he had latterly
    given up, as useless, all these attempts and left them to follow
    their own wills. One great and unexpected difficulty he had found
    impossible to overcome, in consequence of the imperfection of the
    Quiché language, was his inability to convey in equivalent terms
    the ideas he wished to explain. He also experienced another serious
    hindrance in the execution of his duties. His parish was extensive and
    contained several villages which lie amongst the sierras, remote from
    each other; and as the Quiché is an unwritten
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>language, and there are
    consequently no grammars or dictionaries to create a fixed standard,
    words are forgotten, sometimes their meaning becomes changed or they
    are differently accented or applied; and thus, in the course of time,
    the dialect of one village differs from another.</p>

  <p>I observed to the Padre, that, on the way from Sololá, I had noticed
    that the Indians contrived to live in an isolated manner. He said this
    was always the case with them. They were naturally inclined to keep
    much apart. Those who lived amongst the mountains had their huts at
    considerable distances from each other, and the villages maintained
    but little communication; as a natural consequence the language was
    always changing. “All these Quichés,” he said, “are becoming extremely
    ignorant. They keep no record of time or events, and do not seem to
    take interest in anything except the dull procedure of their daily
    lives.”</p>

  <p>The Padre had found it impossible to feel in any degree assured,
    that he understood the private feelings or political views of these
    Indians. He considered them to be apparently indifferent to what
    was passing around them, and yet capable of being aroused in a very
    sudden manner, and of acting together for some common purpose. Their
    enthusiasm for anything relating to their superstitious devotion to the
    images was however very evident. One of the things which he thought
    to be inexplicable, was their extraordinary veneration for the rite
    of baptism. They seemed to attach some peculiar importance to this
    ceremony, although the Padre did not think that what was in their
    minds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
    had any reference to the Church tenets. In all matters connected
    with religion, the Indians had become quite independent. They came from
    afar to make offerings of blossoms and leaves, lighted candles before
    the altars of those saints they wished to honour, and then silently
    returned to their huts.</p>

  <p>In the morning, before leaving San Tomas, I was interested in observing
    in the crowded Plaza, some of the characteristics of this once
    powerful Indian race. The men were of middle size, strongly built and
    of a swarthy copper colour. Their noses were large and remarkably
    broad at the base. Their eyes were dark and wild. In features many
    of them resembled the Sioux. Their voices were loud and the language
    disagreeably rough. The women had soft voices and were very gentle in
    their manners. They reminded me of the Coptic women of Lower Egypt, in
    their method of carrying their pitchers of water. There was the same
    graceful attitude, and slow and steady walk. What perhaps, added to
    some extent to the resemblance was the long blue dress, and the little
    turban-shaped mat placed on the head to receive the pressure of the
    weight.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> journey from San Tomas to Santa Cruz del Quiché was made
    unexpectedly fatiguing, in consequence of the difficulties placed
    across our track by the numerous barrancas which traversed the plains.
    Several of these ravines were of considerable depth, and their slopes
    were abrupt. It was satisfactory to realize that we were travelling
    in the dry season, and the footing for the mules was therefore fairly
    secure.</p>

  <p>Upon our arrival at the village, I rode onwards to the convent steps
    where I was met by Padre Andres Guicola, who was unfeignedly delighted
    to see me. He said that he was glad to welcome me, and talk to somebody
    who was not an Indian, and was particularly pleased to hear that I was
    an Englishman, for he was a Biscayan, and had been born and bred near
    San Sebastian, and had listened to the traditions concerning the great
    Duke of Wellington, and memories, on the part of the ladies,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
    of the brave officers of his army. It added much to the pleasure he felt
    in receiving me, to know that his guest was the son of one of those
    officers, who had not only been present at the operations in Biscay and
    on the French frontier, but was also severely wounded at Albuera, a
    battle held in great respect by all patriotic Spaniards.</p>

  </div>

  <p>His isolation amongst these secluded mountains, must have been
    repugnant to the nature of this kind hearted and genial padre. He told
    me that he had been living in his parish twenty-one years, having been
    appointed in 1849, and during that long time regularly fulfilled his
    duties amongst his Indians. He declared, in answer to some questions
    that I asked with reference to the adjacent ruins of Utatlan, that he
    knew but little except from what he had read in the history of Juarros.
    The friars of the convent wrote some observations about them, and
    also possessed some documents relating to the ancient customs of the
    Quichés, but these were destroyed during the revolution of 1829, when
    the churches and convents were sacked. Consequently no records existed.</p>

  <p>The view from the Convent was magnificent, commanding towards the
    north-west the ranges of the Cordilleras, and towards the south-west
    the hills near Quezaltenango. The lofty plateau upon which it stood,
    was nearly seven thousand feet above the sea. It is upon three sides
    severed from the outer world by a steep barranca which almost surrounds
    it. The ruins of Utatlan, the ancient capital of the Quichés, were
    about one mile distant, and were evidently placed in such a manner as
    to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
    take the greatest advantage of this ravine, in order to form a
    stronghold, which according to the conditions of Indian warfare must
    have been practically impregnable.</p>

  <p>After having obtained some local information respecting the structures
    that I wished to examine, I crossed the plain and entered this
    fortress, which once held the reputation of being one of the greatest
    of the Indian cities. I was prepared to see much that would be of the
    highest interest, because no change had taken place within its walls
    since the time when it was destroyed by Alvarado, in 1524. The site has
    never since that period been occupied or in any way disturbed. Upon
    making a slight preliminary survey of the position, it was evident that
    it had been chosen for a fortified inclosure, in the same manner and
    for the same purpose as Patinamit. Both fortresses resembled in their
    character the defensive encampment of Fort Ancient in Ohio.</p>

  <p>Utatlan is, with the exception of its narrow approach, surrounded by
    ravines. In consequence of the ground being thus confined, the original
    extent of the city can be easily ascertained, and it is therefore
    indisputable that the population maintained within the ramparts could
    never have been numerous. It is however observable that it must have
    contained buildings, temples, and sacrificial altars of considerable
    magnitude. The sites of many of these were still apparent and their
    ground plans could be traced. Portions of the walls were also standing.
    Parts of the altars were covered with a strong thick cement.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

  <p>After having walked round the exterior of the fortress, I made a
    series of measurements of the spaces covered by the courts of those
    structures which were supposed to have been temples or places set apart
    for the purposes of religion and instruction. I observed that some
    of the ground plans were similar in their proportions to those that
    I had noticed within some ancient earthworks near the modern city of
    Guatemala.</p>

  <p>The pyramidal altars or Teocalli had, in their forms and constructions,
    their platforms and places for idols, many points of resemblance with
    others that were known to have existed in Mexico.</p>

  <p>The rectangular courts in front of the altars, were possibly the
    quadrangles within which the ceremonies connected with human sacrifices
    were performed. Nothing is absolutely known with respect to the
    sacrificial customs of the Quichés, and the allusions to them in the
    Quiché manuscripts are not definite. It is, therefore, fortunate that
    there exists a statement made to the King of Spain in the year 1576,
    upon the condition of the country and the customs of the Indians in the
    districts presided over by the government of Guatemala, which describes
    in considerable detail what happened amongst the Chontal and Pipil
    Indians dwelling in the south-eastern parts of the province. It was
    made by the licentiate Don Garcia de Palacio, and with respect to the
    subject of these human sacrifices, there has been nothing written which
    gives so full and evidently accurate an account of those remarkable
    ceremonies. The Report is so valuable and instructive, that it is
    desirable to quote what immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
    relates to them. Palacio, after describing the country near lake Uxaca, says:—</p>

  <p>“Three leagues from this is the village of Micla, where anciently the
    Pipiles Indians of this district performed great devotions, and came
    to offer their gifts and hold their sacrifices; as likewise did the
    Chontales and other adjacent Indians of differing languages. They had
    in their sacrifices some particularities different from other places,
    and had <i>Kues</i> and <i>teupas</i> of great authority, of which there are yet
    large signs and indications.</p>

  <p>“Besides the Cacique and usual chief, they had a Pá-pa<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> whom they
    called <i>Tecti</i>, who was dressed in a long blue robe and wore on the
    head a diadem, and sometimes a mitre worked in different colours, and
    at the top of this a bunch of very fine feathers, from some birds that
    there are in this country, which they call Quetzales.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

  <p>“He commonly carried in his hand a staff like a bishop, and all obeyed
    him in whatever related to spiritual matters. Next to him, the second
    place in the priesthood was held by another who was called <i>tehu a
    matlini</i> who was the chief wizard and most learned in their books and
    arts, and who declared the auguries and made prognostications.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

  <p>“There were, besides these, four priests who were called <i>teu pixqui</i>
    dressed in different colours, and with robes down to their feet, black,
    green, red and yellow; and these were of the council in the matters of
    their ceremonies, and were those who assisted in all the superstitions
    and follies of their heathenism.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

  <p>“There was also a majordomo who had the charge of the jewels and
    ornaments of the sacrifices, and who took out the hearts of those that
    were sacrificed, and performed the other personal things that were
    necessary; and besides there were others who had trumpets and heathen
    instruments to convoke and call together the people to the sacrifices
    that were going to take place.”</p>

  <p>Palacio states that the rising sun was worshipped and that there
    were two idols, one representing a man named Quetzalcoatl and the
    other a woman named Itzqueye and that to these all the sacrifices
    were made. There were two special ceremonies which took place, one
    at the commencement of the winter and the other at the beginning of
    the summer, when two boys between the ages of six and twelve were
    sacrificed. Palacio then describes the sacrificial customs in war:—</p>

  <p>“The high priest, the learned wizard, and the four priests met
    together, and ascertained by their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
    sortileges and witchcrafts whether
    they should have war or if any one was coming against them, and if the
    sortileges said yes, they called the Cacique and captains of war, and
    told them how the enemies were coming, and where they should go to make
    war.</p>

  <p>“The Cacique summoned all his warriors, and went out in search of the
    enemies, and if they gained the victory in the battle, the Cacique
    dispatched a messenger to the high priest, and informed him upon what
    day he had succeeded, and the sage examined unto whom the sacrifice
    should be made. If it was to Quetzalcoatl the ceremonies lasted fifteen
    days, and upon each day one of the Indians of those that had been
    captured in the battle was sacrificed; and if it was to Itzqueye the
    ceremonies lasted five days, and upon each day an Indian was sacrificed.</p>

  <p>“The sacrifice was performed in this manner. All those who had been
    in the war came in order singing and dancing, and they brought those
    that they had to sacrifice, with many feathers and <i>chalchivetes</i><a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
    on their feet and hands, and with strings of cacao upon their neck,
    and the captains conducted them in their midst. The high priest and
    priests together with the people went out to receive them with dances
    and music, and the caciques and captains presented to the high priest
    these Indians for the sacrifices, and then they all went together to
    the court of their <i>teupa</i>, and they danced all the above said days and
    nights.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

  <p>“In the middle of the court they placed a stone like a bench, and upon
    this they placed the Indian that was to be sacrificed, and the four
    priests held the Indian by the hands and feet. The majordomo then came
    out with many feathers and covered with bells, with a stone razor in
    his hand, and opened the breast and pulled out the heart, and when he
    had taken it out he threw it upwards towards each of the four cardinal
    points, and the fifth time he threw it in the middle of the court
    directly upwards, thus declaring and giving to the god the reward for
    the victory. This sacrifice was made in public, so that every one both
    small and great could see it.”</p>

  <p>It is interesting to turn from the customs described as occurring in
    the remote town of Micla, to the events that happened in the city
    of Mexico, several hundreds of leagues distant. It was late in the
    afternoon of a summer’s day, in the year 1521. The Spaniards had
    been repulsed in one of their most important attacks on the enemy,
    and had been driven back over the causeway after suffering serious
    losses; Cortes was wounded, and sixty Spaniards had been captured,
    together with many of their Indian allies. In accordance with the
    Aztec superstitious rites, these captives were at once conveyed to the
    Teocalli of the war gods.</p>

  <p>Bernal Diaz, who had taken a prominent part in the battle, states that
    “during the retreat, they frequently heard the great drum resounding
    with a deep and dismal noise.” At last the Spanish troops reached a
    place of comparative safety, where they were secure from the enemy’s
    attacks, and out of reach of stones and arrows, and then, Diaz says,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
    “Sandoval and Francisco de Lugo, and Andres de Tapia with Pedro de
    Alvarado, were each relating what had happened and what orders Cortes
    had given, when the drum of Huitzopotli again began to sound, together
    with kettledrums, shell horns and other instruments like trumpets, and
    these sounds were horrible and dismal, and we looked at the summit of
    the highest Kue, and we saw our companions who had been captured in
    the rout, and that they were being carried up by force, and with blows
    and thrusts, and being taken violently to be sacrificed, and when they
    had reached the top at a place where was the shrine in which were the
    accursed idols, we saw that many of them had feathers put upon their
    heads, others were made to dance before Huitzopotli, and after they had
    danced they were thrown on their backs on the top of the sacrificial
    stone, and then they cut open their breasts with flint knives, and
    pulled out their heating hearts and offered them to the idols that were
    in that place. The bodies and feet were thrown down the steps below,
    where other Indian butchers were waiting, and who cut off their arms
    and legs, and then flayed the skin from their faces, and tanned them
    like glove skins with the beards on, and kept them to show at their
    festivals and when they had their drunken feasts. In this manner were
    all sacrificed; they devoured the legs and arms, and the hearts and
    blood were offered to the idols.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> These cruelties
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>were seen by the
    whole camp, and by Pedro de Alvarado, and Gonzalo de Sandoval, and all
    the captains, and we said amongst ourselves, thank God that I was not
    carried off to-day to be sacrificed.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

  <p>In the whole range of American history, there is nothing which more
    vividly strikes the imagination than the scenes described by the
    Spanish conquerors during the siege of Mexico. The human sacrifices
    and the subsequent cannibalism, represent the most revolting acts of
    superstition that have ever disgraced human nature.</p>

  <p>It is strange that, although so much has been recorded of the Aztecs
    and their customs, no clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
    account has been given of the shape and
    dimensions of their Teocallis within the city of Mexico. We have only
    very doubtful representations given of them. Taking these as the best
    available guides it is evident that the altars in Utatlan were built
    upon similar principles, following upon a smaller scale the same
    general structural plan and proportions. Utatlan was considered as
    one of the most important places in Central America. According to the
    historian Juarros, it held a rank only second to the capital of the
    Aztecs.</p>

  <p>Alvarado conquered the city in April, 1524, and he states in his
    official Report to Cortes, that in consequence of the natural strength
    of the place, and the depth of the ravines which prevented a general
    action, he had decided to destroy it. He gave directions to burn the
    chief caciques alive, to set fire to the town and completely reduce it
    to ruins, for it was so strong and dangerous, that it was more like a
    stronghold of bandits than a town of citizens.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

  <p>A curious circumstance is mentioned by him as happening during his
    march against Utatlan. On the way, and near some rising ground, he
    saw the Indians sacrifice a woman and a dog, and he says that his
    interpreters told him that this act meant defiance. This statement is
    remarkable because it has always been supposed that dogs were not found
    amongst the Mexicans. Bernal Diaz observes that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>these dogs were of
    small size, that they were used for food, and did not bark.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption">Approach to Utatlan from the plain.<br />
    <span class="small">Height of mound is about 30 feet.</span></div>
  </div>

  <p>Before leaving Utatlan, Alvarado placed in office as chief of the
    Quichés, an Indian named Sequechul, who was according to the laws of
    that race the next in succession. From this time nothing more was known
    of the Quichés, until the licentiate Alonzo de Zurita, passed this way
    about the year 1554, in the execution of the duty assigned to him by
    the command of the king, to report upon the condition and customs of
    the Indians, both before and after the conquest. Zurita was informed
    that, before the conquest, the Quichés had three chiefs. The first had
    over his seat or throne three canopies of feathers, the second two, and
    the third one. He says that the city had at one time contained several
    kues, (small pyramidal altars) dedicated to idols, but that they were
    then in ruins, and the successors of the caciques were in the utmost
    poverty.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

  <p>I passed over the ground where Alvarado’s camp had been pitched,
    and where the caciques were sentenced to be burnt. Certainly the
    sixteenth century witnessed most extraordinary scenes of cruelty
    and carnage in this unhappy country. At this distance of time it
    is difficult to understand what could have been the reasons which
    impelled the Spaniards to burn the Indians in such numbers. Many
    of them were consigned to the flames for disobedience to orders,
    others upon suspicion of treasonable designs against the conquerors,
    others for being discovered worshipping their ancient gods, or for
    not conforming to the new religion. Perhaps the most inexplicable of
    all these cruelties is what happened soon after the conquest of the
    city of Mexico. Cortes, upon his return there after his expedition to
    Honduras, heard that during his absence, there had been a rising of
    Indians in one of the distant provinces, a sort of local rebellion
    which had been suppressed. Upon his making inquiries as to the cause of
    this disaffection, the principal inhabitants of the province came and
    reported to him that the Spaniards under whom they had been placed had
    burnt alive eight of their principal chiefs, five of whom died on the
    spot, and the remaining three a few days afterwards, and although they
    had demanded reparation and justice it had not been granted to them.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

  <p>Later in the century all the penalties of the Inquisition were
    established, but it was found that the results of these acts to enforce
    the Spanish rule, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
    to convert the Indians were unsatisfactory. The
    Indians fled to the hills and forests, and would not obey the orders
    to form communities or villages and thus be exposed to such cruelties.
    Finally the punishment of burning alive was abolished, and the milder
    punishment of whipping at the post was introduced and has remained. It
    is at the present time the customary method of punishing the natives
    for any default or misconduct.</p>

  <p>In considering this subject of the treatment of the Indians at the
    time of the conquest, due weight has to be given to the influence of
    the priests, their enthusiasm, and their intense desire to convert the
    natives by persuasion or by force. The well-known inveterate hatred
    of the Indians towards their conquerors, a hatred which still exists,
    was a dangerous element always present and to be guarded against by
    adopting severe measures of repression. The good fortune that had
    attended the operations of Cortes and his handful of Spaniards in the
    conquest of this region, was doubtless in a great measure due to the
    condition of the country, and the never ceasing tribal wars. Cortes and
    his generals were consequently always able to obtain the assistance of
    numerous allies who were glad to seize any opportunity of destroying
    their enemies. But when the conquest was completed and the Spaniards
    had the lands distributed amongst them, and the system of <i>encomiendas</i>
    was adopted, it became necessary, at all hazards, to prevent any
    combinations of Indians against them, and to put down or crush out with
    unmerciful firmness the slightest tendency to rebel against the iron
    and cruel rule under which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
    found themselves to be subjected. Many
    risings were quelled, all tendency to insubordination was punished,
    and the Indians remained under control. But this result was only
    obtained after these unfortunate tribes had been subjected to the most
    astonishing severities that have ever been inflicted by a civilised
    race of conquerors.</p>

  <p>At the convent at Santa Cruz, Padre Guicola spoke much about his
    parishioners. He said that he was impressed with the conviction that
    the Quichés in many respects still followed their old idolatries, and
    worshipped their idols secretly. He thought that he had discovered
    that certain Indians were “sacerdotes” to these idols, and that in
    some manner which he had not been able to find out, they, amongst
    themselves, maintained their ancient priesthood.</p>

  <p>The accommodation for strangers was more monastic than I had expected
    to find. My cell contained nothing but a wide hard board placed upon
    four legs, and there were neither hooks nor posts to which I could hang
    my hammock, consequently it was not practicable to make convenient
    arrangements for securing comfortable quarters at night.</p>

  <p>Before my departure I had a conversation with the Padre about the
    history of the convent, and the work that used to be carried out by
    the monks. Some of the descendants of the caciques of Utatlan were
    educated by them, and the traditions of the origin and migrations of
    the Quichés were composed by them, whilst they were still capable of
    remembering what had been related concerning their early history. The
    most important of the manuscripts <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
    is stated to have been written in
    1544, by the son of one of the Quiché caciques, who took part in the
    operations of war at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards. The
    Padre was not well acquainted with the subject of the past history of
    his convent, and like the other priests that I had met in the Indian
    parishes, his attention was almost exclusively directed to his duties,
    one of the most significant of which, in the opinion of his Indians,
    was the performance of the rite of baptism.</p>

  <p>I asked him what was the best track to follow in crossing the sierras,
    and he made inquiries for me. Several of the inhabitants of the village
    said, that in the remote parts of the hills I wished to cross, the
    paths were not well known, and might be found to be impracticable, and
    there was the danger of meeting scattered bands of rebels. Augustin
    however informed me, that he had learnt from several of the natives, in
    whom he could place confidence, that we need not expect to meet with
    any serious difficulties, and that in the event of being uncertain
    about the right direction, we might rely upon coming across Indians who
    would guide us. My large Government map was of no use in the matter,
    as nothing was marked upon it except ranges of mountains. Meanwhile
    to guard ourselves against possible trouble, I gave directions that
    we should take with us a sufficient supply of food for ourselves and
    the mules, and thus we started upon our road, without feeling any
    hesitation with regard to our future proceedings.</p>

  <p>In the forenoon we came to a halt amongst the mountains, and Augustin,
    who was proficient in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
    knowledge of making a fire out of the most
    scanty materials, prepared breakfast. Whilst we were thus engaged
    we were passed by numbers of Indians carrying goods and provisions.
    Young and old were hurrying rapidly forward, urged by some impulse
    which we were unable to comprehend, towards a destination which was
    to us unknown. They looked wild and restless, and when addressed were
    shy and reserved. In the evening before sunset we arrived at some
    farm buildings, and I slung my hammock to the rafters of a deserted,
    half-ruined shed. Augustin obtained from an adjoining hut some
    tortillas, frijoles<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and eggs, the three chief elements of Indian
    domestic existence, and with these, together with a good supply of
    sacate for the mules, we made ourselves at home in the Cordilleras.</p>

  <p>In accordance with a custom that I usually adopted whenever it was
    possible, I established friendly relations with an Indian family in the
    neighbourhood in order to obtain some knowledge of their language or
    dialect. I had a list of words in Spanish to which I obtained the local
    equivalents. In this manner I made a small vocabulary of the dialects
    spoken by the Indians amongst the Altos near Guatemala, by the Quichés
    at Santa Cruz and San Tomas, by the Kachiquels near Las Godinas, and by
    the tribe near Patinamit. This custom was not only useful in helping
    me to understand the various links or differences in the tribes that
    we met, but it was also a means of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
    bringing about a small degree of
    friendliness, and of overcoming that very decided unsociability which
    forms such an integral part of the Indian nature.</p>

  <p>At sunrise we were in our saddles, and soon found ourselves to be
    riding over a difficult and rugged country. The hills were steep, and
    the mule tracks, in many places, almost impassable. In the afternoon we
    crossed a high mountain ridge, and then descended towards the Indian
    hamlet of San Lorenzo, and pushed on as fast as possible, in order to
    reach Gueguetenango before the night. On our arrival, we rode up to the
    convent gate, where I was welcomed by Padre Juan Batista de Terran.
    He was in a highly disturbed and irritated state of mind. His convent
    had been battered and almost destroyed by the artillery of the Indian
    rebels, commanded by Cruz, and his church was filled with soldiers who
    had been quartered there, and were eating and drinking, gambling, and
    leading wild and irreverent lives within the shrines.</p>

  <p>On the following day I called upon the Corregidor and obtained a
    passport for Augustin, and then sent him and the baggage mule back
    to Guatemala. He had faithfully performed his duties as guide and
    attendant, and had been careful in looking after the wants of the
    mules, often taking great trouble in finding for them a proper supply
    of forage wherever we were quartered in the night. But he had not
    expected to meet with such rough tracks as we had passed over amongst
    the sierras and down the barrancas, and was glad to be able to return
    by more secure and better known roads.</p>

  <p>The inhabitants of Gueguetenango, at the time of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span> our arrival, were
    in an excited and disorganised condition. They had not recovered from
    the alarm caused by the recent events of the rebellion. The Plaza
    was crowded with wild-looking Indians, and throughout the town there
    was an unusual movement of armed men. My chief preoccupation was the
    search of a trustworthy guide, which was a matter for considerable
    difficulty. Finally I succeeded in securing the services of an Indian
    belonging to a local tribe of the Mams. He bore the name of Carlos, and
    spoke Spanish sufficiently well to enable me to keep up a tolerably
    intelligible conversation with him.</p>

  <p>I now thought it advisable to make some changes with regard to the
    manner of travelling. Hitherto I had managed very well with Augustin
    and one spare mule. The mule carried in the saddle bags, provisions
    for several days, together with a change of clothing in case of wet
    weather, but experience had shown me that it would be better to reduce
    the weights to what could easily be carried by an Indian in his pack,
    and who, at the same time, could act as guide. I should thus avoid the
    risk of being detained by any accident happening to the cargo mule.
    My own good mule carried nothing but its rider, and a great coat and
    hammock, rolled up in military fashion, and strapped over the pommel of
    the saddle.</p>

  <p>Everything being satisfactorily arranged, Carlos appeared at the
    convent steps at daybreak with his pack duly placed over his shoulders,
    and carried by the head band. Into this were put two days’ provisions,
    and part of the change of clothing. My
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> mule carried the halter wound
    round her neck. A small supply of fodder was added to the Indian’s
    load, and thus we started. Carlos took the lead by breaking into a
    quick, rapid pace, or steady Indian run. The mule followed at her
    best speed, and before the sun had risen above the summits of the
    Cordilleras, we were well forward on our way towards Jacaltenango and
    the Mexican frontier.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <blockquote>
    <p>Gueguetenango, the chief city of the Department, was a place
      of importance before the conquest. It was the capital of the
      Mams, a warlike tribe, whose caciques and principal families
      were of the same race as the Quichés. They were conquered
      and reduced to submission by the Spaniards in 1525. There
      are certain circumstances respecting that campaign and the
      methods of defence adopted by the Mams, which should receive
      particular attention in connection with the theories and Indian
      traditions, respecting the migrations of the mysterious tribe
      who have been named the Toltecs, and who appear to have been
      the predecessors of the Aztecs. There are, in the accounts of
      the campaign several details which are valuable, as leading to
      the conclusion that the Mams, Quichés and Kachiquels, whose
      leaders were all of the same race, pursued systems of defensive
      warfare, which had analogies with the habits of the tribes who
      raised the fortified hill works in Ohio.</p>

    <p>When it was decided by Alvarado to attack the Mams, a force
      suitable for the purpose was organized. It consisted of a main
      body of Mexican Indian allies who were supported by a small
      force of Spanish cavalry and infantry; there were three hundred
      Indians carrying spades and hatchets acting as pioneers, and
      many others who were employed in the work of transport. After
      an engagement with the Mams, who were defeated, the attacking
      forces advanced to <a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>Gueguetenango. Upon their arrival at
      that place the Spanish General was informed that the Mams had
      retreated to their fortress of Socoleo. The position of this
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
      entrenched camp was so strong, that it was not possible to
      capture it by direct assault, and the Spaniards in the end
      reduced the Indians to surrender by famine.</p>

    <p>The historian Fuentes who is stated to have personally examined
      this fortress about the year 1695, reported (according to
      Juarros) that the approach “was by only one entrance and that
      was so narrow as scarcely to permit a horseman to pass it; from
      the entrance, there ran on the right hand a parapet, raised
      on the berm of the fosse, extending along nearly the whole of
      that side; several vestiges of the counter-scarp and curtain
      of the walls still remain, besides parts of other works, the
      use of which cannot now be easily discovered; in a courtyard
      there stood some large columns, upon the capitals of which were
      placed quantities of pine wood, that being set on fire, gave
      light at night to the surrounding neighbourhood. The citadel or
      lofty cavalier of this great fortification was in the form of
      a square, graduated pyramid, rising twelve or fourteen yards
      from the base to the platform on the top, which was sufficient
      to admit of ten soldiers standing on each side; the next
      step would accommodate a greater number, and the dimensions
      proportionably increased to the last or twenty-eighth step.
      The steps were intersected in unequal portions by parapets
      and curtains, rendering the ascent to the top so extremely
      difficult, that Fuentes says, he attempted several times to
      reach the platform, but was unable to perform the task, until
      his Indian interpreter acted as his guide and conducted him
      to the summit. The ruins of several buildings were then in
      existence; they appeared to have been intended as quarters for
      the soldiers; were extremely well arranged, and distributed
      with due regard to proportion. Between each three or four of
      these buildings there was a square courtyard paved with slabs
      made of stiff clay, lime, and sand; every part of the fortress
      was constructed of hewn stone, in pieces of great size, as
      one which had been displaced, measured three yards in length,
      by one in breadth.” ... “As the place was circumvallated by
      a deep ravine, there was no way by which the walls could be
      approached.”</p>

    <p>From the above description of Socoleo it is made clear that
      its construction and position were in accordance with the
      principles and objects which governed the selection of the
      strongholds at Patinamit and Utatlan. The pyramidal structure
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
      called the citadel must have closely resembled the Resguardo
      which guarded the entrance into the Quiché fortress.</p>

    <p>It is of importance to note that the account given by Fuentes
      of Socoleo, establishes to a great extent, the accuracy of
      certain portions of the manuscripts composed by the young
      Quiché caciques which relate to the traditions of the
      migrations of the Quichés from Mexico, and the manner in which
      they divided into separate governments the countries which they
      had conquered, under the names of Quiché, Kachiquel, Mam and
      Zutugil. With regard to the three first-named divisions the
      methods adopted to secure their domination, were so identical,
      that there can be no doubt that the statements recorded in the
      manuscripts, so far as they relate to the historical accounts
      of the Quichés after their arrival in Central America, may be
      assumed to be trustworthy records of the Indian traditions.</p>

    <p>According to the dispatches of the Spanish conqueror Alvarado,
      he found that the Quichés inhabited the town of Quezaltenango,
      and it was after the decisive battle fought near that place,
      that they retreated to their entrenchments at Utatlan; thus
      adopting the same tactics as were afterwards followed by the
      Mams, who fought their chief battle near Gueguetenango and then
      after their defeat fled to Socoleo. This custom of the Quichés
      appears to be similar to that of the Mound Builders in Ohio,
      who established their fortified camps in positions which were
      naturally nearly impregnable or most difficult to approach,
      and it is such as would be considered advisable by the chiefs
      of tribes who hold their territories by conquest, and would
      therefore endeavour to maintain their power by having large
      entrenched encampments, within which they would be secured from
      danger in the event of being unable to meet their enemies on
      the plains.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> our way to Jacaltenango we had to cross the Sierra Madre, a range
    of mountains which traverses the centre of Guatemala. The mule track
    led us over some steep and rugged ascents, and through a long and deep
    barranca filled with a cold damp mist. During the greater part of the
    day we were enveloped in clouds which covered the summits of the hills.
    We finally reached the hamlet of Todos Santos, and obtained shelter at
    an Indian rancho.</p>

  <p>Towards nightfall we heard the distant bell of the chapel ringing
    for evening prayer.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
    stood in front of their huts,
    and looking in the direction of the sound of the bell, recited the
    Ave Maria. This is one of the religious customs taught by the Spanish
    friars that retains its influence upon the inhabitants of these remote
    highlands.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption smcap">Indian Huts.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Darkness rapidly succeeds daylight in tropical latitudes, and upon my
    return to the rancho I observed that the hut was lighted by a method
    mentioned by the early historians of the conquest as having been in
    universal use amongst the Mexican Indians. In the centre of the room
    was a rude wooden stand, upon which was placed crosswise, a lighted
    piece of resinous pinewood. The flame gave a sufficient light for all
    practical purposes. After turning into my hammock, I watched by the
    fitful glare of the firebrand, the domestic habits of the Indians. The
    first thing done, was to put the child to bed, and this was managed in
    the following manner:—The mother wrapped the child tightly in swaddling
    clothes, until it looked like a mummy. The head was left exposed. It
    was then fastened upon a flat board about three feet high and eighteen
    inches wide. This board was put upright against an angle of the wall.
    The child remained throughout the night perfectly quiet. The bed upon
    which the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
    father and mother slept, was a low wide frame resting on
    four legs, and raised a few inches above the ground. Everything was of
    the rudest simplicity. The smoke from the fire rose directly upwards
    and escaped through the roof.</p>

  <p>In the morning, while Carlos was making a cup of chocolate, the Indian
    came to my side and said that he wished to ask me a question about the
    people who lived beneath the earth (abaxo). He had been told, that men
    like ourselves were living and moving about below us, and he could not
    understand how this was possible. I endeavoured to explain to him that
    the world was round, and that on the other side of the earth beneath,
    things were much the same as at Todos Santos. My attempts to teach the
    laws of gravitation were, however, not successful, and he went away in
    a state of bewilderment, probably under the impression that the people
    below were upside down.</p>

  <p>After leaving the hamlet, we passed by the little church whose bell
    we had heard upon the previous night. The door was closed, and I
    noticed that it was charred by burning and blackened by smoke. I was
    told that this remote church was frequently closed during the time
    that the priest was away in other parts of the district, and when the
    Indians came here, they stuck lighted candles upon the door as nearly
    as possible in the direction of the image to which they wished to make
    their offerings. The church door was consequently deeply marked by the
    flames. Here, as also before the closed doors of other chapels in the
    mountains, the Indians have the custom of raising a temporary altar
    outside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
    before which they place offerings, and sit patiently in
    silence for many hours. They then fill a brazier with chips of resinous
    wood, and light their candles and the brazier and go away to their
    huts, leaving the incense burning. This is possibly a survival of the
    ancient usage of burning copal incense before their idols.</p>

  <p>During the forenoon we went over several steep ranges of hills, and
    down very abrupt descents until we arrived at the village of St.
    Martin, when we stopped at a deserted shed, and Carlos proposed that
    he should get ready the breakfast. It was always a pleasure to watch
    an Indian lighting a fire. His materials are usually a few dry sticks,
    some leaves, a flint, a steel, and a roll of prepared cotton, which,
    when slightly burnt, easily catches fire from the sparks of the flint.
    There was often, however, a difficulty in getting the fuel to burst
    into a flame, and the steady persistent patience of Indians in doing
    this is extraordinary. It was a great comfort in riding amongst the
    sierras, to have always the power of making a fire. It was of still
    greater importance to carry your own bed.</p>

  <p>Each morning when starting upon a journey over an unknown country,
    with much uncertainty as to where quarters would be found for the
    night, there was a sense of satisfaction in seeing placed upon the
    pommel of the saddle the hammock in which you intended to sleep. It
    gave freedom from all anxiety with regard to the future. There was
    no cause to feel any doubts respecting the beds at a Spanish posada,
    or the rough interior of an Indian hut, and there was always the
    prospect of obtaining, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
    the fatigues of the day, a good night’s
    rest. In thus travelling and having at hand sufficient provisions and
    fuel to guard against being by any accident in want amongst these
    mountainous regions, there was a feeling of independence which was
    very exhilarating. This kind of gipsy, Bohemian life was singularly
    attractive, and the small element of risk from the possibility of
    meeting hostile Indians was too slight to have any influence upon the
    mind. There was a certain degree of solitude in thus riding without a
    companion, as the guide ran several hundred yards ahead, but this was
    not much felt, for there was a never ending change of scene, and every
    hour brought something new and unexpected.</p>

  <p>In the evening as we descended the slopes of the valleys, we met
    numbers of Indians carrying heavy loads on their backs. I had noticed
    when riding amongst the higher parts of these hills that crosses were
    placed upon all remarkable positions, and at the corners where paths
    branched off towards the hamlets. When passing these crosses the men
    invariably took off their broad straw hats, and showed by their manner
    great respect.</p>

  <p>I was surprised at observing in the valleys that the Indians suffered
    much from goitre. This unsightly growth seemed chiefly to affect
    the women. It was the same in size and appearance as that which
    exists amongst the inhabitants of several of the secluded valleys in
    Switzerland.</p>

  <p>At intervals during the afternoon we heard the distant sound of the
    beating of a drum calling the attention of the Indians for some purpose
    which we did not then understand. When we drew near
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span> to Jacaltenango
    we became aware that something was occurring which caused considerable
    excitement amongst the people. We passed an open space at the entrance
    of the pueblo, upon which had been built, temporarily, a “Santo” house.
    It was a small round hut, within which was an image, which had been
    removed from the church and placed there, in order that it should
    receive special honour and devotion. Before this shrine a dance was
    taking place. It represented incidents of the wars between the Spanish
    Christians and the Moors during the period when the latter were finally
    driven out of Spain. A little beyond the “Santo” house was the church
    where an Indian festival was in progress, and an orchestra was busily
    engaged within, performing a musical service. I stopped for a few
    minutes to look at the strange and fantastical scene, and the groups of
    swarthy, wild-looking Indians, and then rode on to the convent, where
    we were welcomed by Padre Juan Chrysostemos Robles. My guide Carlos
    went away to join in the festivities of his tribe.</p>

  <p>In the morning an Indian passed rapidly through the village beating a
    small drum, and later in the day, a large crowd of Indians assembled
    in the square in front of the church. It thus became known that an
    important meeting was to be held in order to bring about a settlement
    of some difficulty or disagreement between two hamlets, with respect
    to the buying and selling of lands. About three hundred of the men,
    chiefly interested, gathered together. The speaking began in tones so
    harsh that it was almost inconceivable that human
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> language could have
    developed into such rough and grating sounds.</p>

  <p>These Mams were men of strong and muscular frames, compact and well
    made, but they were all short in stature. Their general appearance was
    wild and they had a restless manner. They came from the adjacent hills,
    and it was noticeable with them as with other Indians I had seen in
    the mountains, that they were darker than those living on the plains.
    The meeting lasted for about an hour, and as soon as the business
    was ended they immediately left Jacaltenango and returned to their
    homes. I was told that the matter in dispute had been settled to the
    satisfaction of all present, and that there was no longer any fear of
    local disturbances.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the numerous orchestral services within the church were still
    proceeding. It was a curious scene. The chief instrument was a large
    wooden marimba made on the principle of short and long sounding boards,
    the upper notes of which were played by the leading performers, whilst
    three other men kept up a continuous accompaniment on the bass. It was
    evidently an improvement upon the African marimba which had probably
    been introduced into America by the negro slaves. There were also
    violins and several rudely constructed guitars. The musical ceremonies
    were performed before the altars, the Indian congregation maintaining
    a complete silence. Not the least strange part of the function was the
    fact that Padre Robles was an unconcerned spectator, although it was
    his church that was occupied by the Indians and his
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> “Santos” that were
    being carried about and worshipped, and to whom offerings were made.</p>

  <p>Although the music was noisy and monotonous, the players seemed to have
    a correct knowledge of harmony. The Padre explained how this happened.
    He said that this comparative knowledge of music was obtained in
    consequence of the teaching of the friars before the dissolution of the
    monasteries. These friars devoted much of their time to the education
    of a certain number of Indian lads in orchestral music, in order to
    train them to take part in the church services, and he supposed that
    the instruction then given was kept up in some way which he did not
    understand, and that young Indians were taught in their villages for
    this work. He thought that the preparations for the church festivals
    and for the dances were also arranged in a similar manner.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon we went to the entrance of one of the valleys, as the
    Padre wished to show me the position of an Indian “<i>adoratorio</i>”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
    situated on the side of a steep mountain. He said he had not seen it,
    but had been told by his Indians what occurred there. An idol, held
    in much reverence by the Mams had its shrine inside, and the Alcaldes
    charged with the duties of the religious rites and other ceremonies
    relating to Indian sacerdotalism, visited it at certain seasons of
    the year and offered sacrifices to it. The idol had also days for the
    performance of penances, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
    and there was one special day when there
    was a solemn feast, and turkeys were killed and eaten with peculiar
    observances, and the blood of the turkeys was sprinkled and offered in
    a manner unknown to him.</p>

  <p>After passing through the place where the “Santo” house was erected,
    and before which dances and other ceremonies were still going on, we
    returned to the convent.</p>

  <p>Soon after sunset an event occurred which proved that a disturbance
    had taken place in the interior of the earth. We were sitting inside
    the precincts when we were alarmed by, what was to me, a quite unknown
    rumbling sound amongst the adjacent mountains. At first I thought that
    it was caused by distant thunder reverberating amongst the valleys,
    but it was soon evident that the sounds were of an entirely different
    character.</p>

  <p>The Padre, who was listening attentively to the noise, said, after
    a few moments’ pause, that it was a “Temblor” or trembling of the
    earth below, and that it was quite different from a “Terra Moto” or
    earthquake, as it never caused any harm, although it was considered to
    be a warning. According to my map, the nearest crater was the Volcan de
    Tacara, fourteen leagues away in a south-easterly direction. The deep
    sounds rolled like thunder beneath the massive ranges of the Sierra
    Madre.</p>

  <p>When living amongst these mountains, and hearing these intimations of
    great volcanic movements below the surface of the ground, it can be
    understood how it came to pass that the superstitious and fanatical
    Indians living in these regions believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
    that the earth beneath them
    was peopled by evil demons capable of doing injury, who required to be
    propitiated, and that when seeing the expression of their anger in the
    fire, smoke and ashes issuing from the craters, thought it necessary
    to appease them by offering them their daughters. It is probable that
    the sacrifices known to have taken place to the volcanoes near Atitlan
    and Quezaltenango were also customary throughout the long range of
    volcanoes in this part of Central America.</p>

  <p>When talking about the present customs of the Indians living in these
    sierras, the Padre said that the ancient rule of young men serving for
    a certain time the parents of the girl they wished to marry had ceased,
    and that now it was usual for an Indian to make up his mind on the
    subject, and then to begin his courtship by giving presents of maize,
    fowls, or clothing to the parents.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Finally he proposes to take the
    girl in marriage, and if they consent, he pays for her according to
    his means, generally about two dollars, but sometimes as much as eight
    dollars.</p>

  <p>Upon the morning of our departure from Jacaltenango, whilst I was
    engaged in superintending the saddling of the mule and the various
    preparations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
    for the day’s journey, which from the neglected state
    of the road was expected to be long and fatiguing, I observed Padre
    Robles walking rapidly backwards and forwards in front of the convent,
    evidently in a state of much anxiety and alarm.</p>

  <p>Presently, when Carlos had moved to another part of the courtyard, the
    Padre hurried to my side and said, in a very decided tone, “Señor you
    must go back at once to Guatemala.” I said, “What is the meaning of
    this! What has happened?” He replied, “I must not tell you, but I know
    that if you do not go back to Guatemala you will be robbed and perhaps
    killed,” and, he added with a look of much distress, “they will steal
    your beautiful mule.” I told him that it was quite impossible that I
    should return to Guatemala, and that I intended to go forward. “But,”
    I said, “if you know anything about which I ought to be informed, you
    should tell me what it is that you fear.”</p>

  <p>After some hesitation, he took me aside close to the convent wall and
    said, “It is this, Señor: last night my housekeeper overheard two
    Indians talking together in a low tone. One of them was your guide,
    the other was a man whom she did not know, and she listened to what
    they were saying. They were sitting in a corner of the courtyard, just
    beneath her window, and she could hear what they said. She heard them
    arrange a plan to rob you and to take away your mule. Their plan was
    this: At about an hour’s journey from this pueblo, you have to pass a
    long hedgerow of aloes; when you arrive at the aloes, an Indian will
    jump out from behind them into the road. Your guide will then come to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
    you and say, that the man is his brother who wishes to go to Comitan,
    and he will ask if he may be permitted to accompany you. After you
    have gone on for some distance, the Indians intend to come behind you
    and take a favourable opportunity to attack and rob you, and, whatever
    happens you will certainly lose your mule.”</p>

  <p>After walking together within the quadrangle for a few minutes to
    discuss the subject, I said, that I had no reason to doubt the fidelity
    of Carlos. He had been recommended to me by the priest at Gueguetenango
    as a trustworthy guide, and was considered to be a good and honest
    man. He had proved himself, so far, to be faithful, and was willing
    and careful; consequently I should still continue to place confidence
    in him. With respect to the conversation that had taken place, I
    thought that the housekeeper must have made some mistake, and had been
    unreasonably alarmed. In any case, however, I said it was necessary for
    me to proceed across the frontier. The Padre looked very unhappy, so I
    told him that he must not be anxious about my fate, and that I would
    take care to send him information about my movements. I hoped that he
    would soon hear of my safe arrival in Mexico. He then gave me a letter
    of introduction to his brother Captain Robles, who commanded the small
    force stationed on the frontier at Lenton.</p>

  <p>By this time Carlos had filled his pack, fitted the head band over his
    forehead, and was waiting to start; so I said good-bye to the kind
    Padre, and as I turned round in the saddle to get a last glimpse of
    Jacaltenango, the most beautifully situated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
    village that I had seen in
    Guatemala, I observed him watching us from the top of the convent steps.</p>

  <p>I had ridden about a league or more and had quite forgotten all about
    the housekeeper and her forecast of events, when I noticed that we were
    approaching a long row of tall aloes bordering the left side of the
    path, and soon afterwards an Indian—a most villainous and evil-looking
    scoundrel—jumped from his place of concealment amongst the aloes and
    stood before me on the road. At the same moment Carlos ran back close
    to the mule’s head and told me that this man was his brother who wished
    to go to Comitan and asked permission to join us.</p>

  <p>The scene was like the realisation of a dream. For a few moments I was
    in doubt as to the best course to pursue, but having been forewarned
    I was forearmed, and knowing that the Indians could not have the
    slightest idea that I was aware of their plans, I decided to go on
    without showing them that I had any suspicions. I said to Carlos “you
    tell me that this man is your brother and perhaps you are stating the
    truth, but he is a stranger to me and I do not like his appearance.”
    However I gave him permission to join us. Carlos thanked me, and the
    other Indian, who did not understand Spanish, gave a guttural sound of
    satisfaction, and then both men ran forward and kept their places well
    in front, at about a hundred yards distance.</p>

  <p>In the forenoon we passed St. Marcos and halted at St. Andres, in
    a district remarkable for the luxuriant growth of fruit trees and
    plantains. We then descended a long hill at the foot of which we halted
    for breakfast.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

  <p>As the mule had shown signs of distress, I took off the saddle and
    noticed that there was a broad low swelling upon her back. A muleteer
    happened to be passing by on his way to Jacaltenango, and I asked him
    to examine the swelling and give me his opinion about it. He told me
    that the mule was ill from a “pica de luna” or moonstroke, and that
    upon some previous night I must have tethered her out in the open air
    exposed to the light of the full moon, whilst her back was still warm
    after the saddle had been removed. I said that I remembered this having
    been done. The muleteer said that the injurious effects of the moon
    was well known, and that the mule ought not to have been exposed to
    it so soon after I had dismounted. He thought that the swelling would
    not prevent my riding her, provided that the pressure was taken off by
    resting the saddle upon pads placed upon each side of the swelling, and
    he arranged some rolls of padding for the purpose.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon we were going through a desolate and uninhabited
    part of the country, when I observed that my guide and his brother
    were lagging on the way. Finally they dropped behind, and began to
    run together a few yards in the rear. The time had now come when it
    was necessary to take a decisive action. I had to be careful not to
    let Carlos suppose that there were any doubts in my mind about his
    fidelity, for I knew nothing of the road, and it was important that I
    should appear to have entire confidence in his guidance.</p>

  <p>I stopped the mule, and called Carlos up to my side, and said, “Carlos,
    you must not run behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
    me. You are the guide, and must keep in front
    to enable me to follow you, and not miss the track, and,” I added in
    a more marked manner, “remember that you are to keep well ahead. Let
    there not be any mistake in this matter, and your brother is to be with
    you.” Carlos immediately obeyed my orders. There was no danger to be
    apprehended so long as this precaution was taken, for I always carried
    with me a small loaded revolver to defend myself in case of attack, an
    event which I thought to be improbable.</p>

  <p>When we arrived at Lenton, we were given rooms within the quarters
    of the garrison. Captain Robles, the commandant, showed me every
    attention, and at supper I joined the officers’ mess. In the morning
    it was found that although every possible care was taken to raise
    the saddle above the swelling, the mule could not bear any pressure.
    Consequently I asked Captain Robles if he could provide me with a
    horse. After some difficulty an animal was obtained, which although of
    very rough appearance, I thought would answer the purpose of carrying
    me the two days’ journey to Comitan. An Indian lad, called a mozo, was
    hired to bring the horse back, and lead my disabled mule. By the time
    that all these arrangements were completed it was getting late in the
    morning. More than three hours daylight were lost, and it was important
    with regard to my Indians to reach our next stopping place before
    sunset.</p>

  <p>For eight leagues the road led through a dreary desert without any
    signs of habitation, and then we reached a pond called San José where
    we halted for an hour. It was quite dark when we reached a hut
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span> near
    Sinigiglia within the Mexican frontier, and where I decided to stop. An
    Indian and his wife were inside, but they not only refused to open the
    door and give us shelter, but to all applications for food or water,
    replied in the words so usually employed by all Indians when asked for
    anything, “No hay.” “There is nothing.” The only thing to be done was
    to make the best of the circumstances, so a supper was made from our
    store of provisions, and with the saddle for a pillow, and the hammock
    stretched upon the ground, I passed the night.</p>

  <p>On the following day the sun was sinking below the horizon when we
    entered the town of Comitan, and I was not sorry to find myself within
    the walls of a comfortable posada, called the Hotel de la Libertad,
    where I was given a room looking into the court. I was not, however,
    destined to pass the night without disturbance.</p>

  <p>After having been asleep for several hours I was startled by hearing
    a peculiar noise. It was a gentle and continuous tapping, accompanied
    by the word Señor spoken in a low, soft voice. It was quite dark so
    I lighted the candle and asked who was there, and I heard “Señor it
    is your mozo from Lenton, and I have brought your saddle, and wish to
    speak to you.” I opened the door and told the lad to explain the reason
    for coming to me in the middle of the night. He came in looking very
    frightened and said that he was afraid of my Indians for he thought
    they were bad men. He had heard them say that it was their intention
    to go back with him, and he feared that when they were in the deserted
    part of the country they would steal the horse; so he came to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span> ask my
    permission to leave at once. The Indians were asleep but he was afraid
    that they would soon awake and prevent him from getting away alone.
    He said also that the mule was safe in the stable, and that he had
    brought with him the saddle, sheepskin and halter which he placed upon
    the floor in a corner of the room. I thought that the fears of the lad
    were perhaps well founded, and gave him directions to leave at once and
    get on as fast as possible. As he still looked anxious, I assured him
    that measures should be taken to prevent the Indians from following him
    for several hours. The mozo thanked me and disappeared into the dark
    courtyard, and I never heard of him or the horse again. It is to be
    hoped that he arrived at his village in safety.</p>

  <p>Shortly before sunrise I was awoke by a loud tapping at the door. This
    time it was the landlord who came to tell me that my Indians were
    making a great noise and were very excited. They were calling out
    that the mozo had gone away during the night with my horse, and they
    wished to see me immediately and be paid and discharged. I told the
    landlord what had happened and that the mozo had left by my orders, and
    then requested him not to permit the Indians to leave the inn, and to
    tell them that I would not see them before the middle of the day. “I
    understand you,” said the landlord, “and will do all that is necessary.”</p>

  <p>In the afternoon at the time when I estimated that if the mozo had made
    a proper use of his start he would be at least forty miles away, the
    Indians were discharged, and an hour afterwards I was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> informed that
    they had been seen on the road running fast towards the frontier.</p>

  <p>It was now necessary to take steps to cure the mule and get a guide.
    Don Manuel Castillo, to whom I had a letter of introduction, was away
    at his hacienda, but his friend Don Mariana Godillo in the kindest
    manner undertook to arrange everything for me. Upon an examination
    of the mule it was considered advisable that she should have a few
    days’ rest to allow the swelling to subside, and in the meanwhile, the
    experience of local muleteers was made available in applying the most
    approved remedies.</p>

  <p>During this time the town of Comitan was in a state of unusual
    excitement in consequence of the arrival of numerous bands of Indians
    to take part in the festival of San Caralampio, to whom was dedicated
    one of the churches. In front of that church numerous Indians were
    assembled. In some respects the scene was like that which took place at
    Jacaltenango, but the proceedings were more of the character of a fair
    than of a religious ceremony. The plaza was covered with booths, and a
    local Indian traffic was being busily transacted. Indian musicians with
    drums, fifes, and fiddles were engaged in making an incessant noise.
    The interior of the church was always crowded, and continuous services
    were performed at the shrines. The women wore white hoods which were
    drawn tightly across the lower part of their faces. The men usually
    wore black yergas.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

  <p>Upon the fourth morning of my stay in the town, as I could not see any
    signs of improvement in the state of the mule, and it was necessary not
    to lose any more time, I held a small meeting of experts in the stable.
    It was thought that some weeks must elapse before she would be fit to
    travel, and Señor Godillo proposed to give me one of his best mules in
    exchange for her, and also insisted upon giving me twenty dollars, as
    he considered my mule to be well worth that additional value. In the
    end this arrangement was carried out, and thus with infinite regret I
    parted with my intelligent and sure-footed companion.</p>

  <p>It was reported at Comitan that the border provinces toward Palenque
    had become settled and had ceased to be in a lawless condition. This
    state of things was undoubtedly due to the remarkable influence of
    the President Juarez over the Indian tribes, and it was probable that
    the cause of this influence was attributable to the fact that, like
    Carrera, the first President of the Republic of Guatemala, he was by
    birth an Indian.</p>

  <p>Juarez was known to be an Indian of a good unmixed stock. He was born
    in Oaxaca, the province bordering Chiapas on the west. Of his early
    youth but little is known, but as a young man he took a prominent
    part in the political movements which preceded the declaration
    of Independence. He was elected a Deputy to the Congress, and in
    1858 became President, and was given very extensive authority. In
    considering the characteristics and capacity of the Indians in
    Central America, it can never be forgotten that, during a period of
    great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
    revolutionary agitation, two unknown Indians should, in a most
    extraordinary manner, have risen to the surface, and controlled the
    destinies of the new Republics.</p>

  <p>Under such conditions, requiring much administrative ability, it
    might have reasonably been expected that men of a white race, either
    Spaniards or belonging to the large population of half-castes of
    partly Spanish descent, would, in consequence of their superior
    qualifications, or their education, or military training, have taken
    the lead in these revolutions. As a matter of racial capacity, it
    is strange that ordinary Indians with absolutely no help from their
    surrounding circumstances, should have attained the highest power.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a fine February morning when we left Comitan. An Indian named
    Lopez was hired to guide me as far as Ocosingo, three days’ journey
    distant. No trustworthy man could be found who was acquainted with the
    country beyond that place. With regard to the subject of safety and
    fidelity, it was arranged that Lopez should receive half his wages in
    advance and the remainder upon his return. The money was deposited
    with my friend who engaged him. Lopez was also to bring back a letter
    from me to the effect that he had performed his duty, and that I
    was satisfied with his conduct. These measures of precaution were
    considered to be advisable.</p>

  <p>After a long day’s ride we reached a place where we decided to pass the
    night. It was upon an open plain where we saw some muleteers encamped.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
    As there were no trees upon which to hang the hammock, it was necessary
    to sleep on the ground. There was a heavy mist and everything was very
    damp. We noticed that the muleteers had taken off the halters from
    their mules and tied them together and placed the long rope thus made
    in a circle, within which they were sleeping. Lopez said that I must
    follow the same plan, which he explained to be a method employed to
    prevent serpents from crawling near them, the rough fibrous nature of
    the halter being so disagreeable to them that they would not pass over
    it. Consequently I was encircled in this manner and with a saddle for
    a pillow, endeavoured to get rest, but the thick mist was the cause of
    much discomfort. Lopez passed the time on guard, watching the mule.</p>

  <p>The next day as early as possible we continued our journey. After
    passing a few huts called Jotána, we entered upon a wide expanse of
    undulating land well studded with trees. Here we met some Mexicans
    travelling on their way from their hacienda or farm. They were men,
    women, boys and girls, all bright and gay, riding horses and mules,
    galloping over the smooth grass land and enjoying the sunny weather.
    I took the opportunity of occasionally joining the laughing cheerful
    group, and I was sorry when we had to part company and follow different
    paths.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon we reached a steep, sharp ascent. The track was
    difficult to trace, and in several places was almost impassable. Large
    masses of stone had fallen over it. There were also numerous deep,
    slippery ruts, through which the mule plunged with difficulty. It was
    sunset when, after having made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
    our way over several leagues of this
    rough ground, we came to an open space, where it was thought expedient
    to stop. We found two trees, between which the hammock was secured.
    The mule was tethered within reach, and Lopez went to an adjacent wood
    and got some twigs and leaves to enable us to make a fire. This was a
    work of difficulty requiring great patience; no one but an Indian would
    have succeeded. The first supply of fuel, after half an hour’s useless
    endeavour, could not be ignited, and Lopez made a second expedition
    to find drier materials. Finally, when I thought that it was useless
    to continue the attempt, an accidental spark suddenly set fire to a
    dry leaf and we were soon sitting round a blazing mass of flame, and
    preparing a supper of tortillas and chocolate.</p>

  <p>The air was too chilly and damp to permit of our expecting much rest,
    and the night was chiefly occupied in attending to the fire, and
    in listening to Lopez’s account of his superstitions and religious
    beliefs, and those generally held by his tribe. There was something
    in Lopez’s character which showed that he was possessed of a kind of
    devotional enthusiasm, which made his stories of Indian faiths, past
    and present, singularly interesting, because it was evident that he
    spoke with earnestness and as a man convinced. Thus the night passed
    away, and in the morning as soon the earliest signs of dawn appeared in
    the sky, and long before the sun had risen over the hills, we continued
    our journey northwards through Chiapas.</p>

  <p>In the forenoon we reached the hamlet of San Carlos. I observed that
    Lopez went to the rising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
    ground near at hand, and stood for several
    moments facing the sun, with the palms of his hands joined together and
    raised to the level of his face. He seemed to be muttering a request.
    When he returned I asked him what he had been doing. He said that the
    Indians of his tribe always thanked the sun in the morning for coming
    and giving light, and thus enabling men to work. In the evening they
    again thanked the sun for what had been done, and asked it to return
    again. They also offered prayers to the moon for the same reason,
    because it gave light and helped men to live. The stars they did not
    worship.</p>

  <p>In answer to questions that I put to him, he said that the Indians
    always prayed or made offerings with reference to the world in which
    they lived, and for objects relating to themselves and their wants,
    and never took into consideration anything regarding a future life.
    He thought it was impossible to know if a man was to live again, or
    whether he was to be given some other shape or kind of existence.
    I told Lopez about the “adoratorio” in the Sierra Madre above
    Jacaltenango. He declared that the Indians near Comitan also had a
    stone image in a cave amongst the hills. He went there once a year to
    light a candle, “la sua candela,” before it, but it was usual amongst
    the men of his tribe to go there more frequently. The image was about
    two feet six inches in height, and had its arms folded. It was one of
    the ancient idols worshipped before the conquest.</p>

  <p>From San Carlos there was a ride of six leagues over a less difficult
    road, and as we approached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
    Ocosingo we passed through some fine
    scenery. The path followed the line of the summit of the hills, and
    commanded extensive views of both valleys. At Ocosingo, I called upon
    Don Remigio Salorzano, to whom I carried a note of introduction. Don
    Remigio told me that the ancient Indian ruins were over a league from
    the pueblo, but that there was very little to be seen there.</p>

  <p>The temples were almost destroyed, and the materials had been taken
    away for building purposes. There were, however, fragments of stones
    covered with hieroglyphic characters still remaining there. I went with
    him to look at some idols that had been brought from the ruins. One of
    these at once arrested my attention. It was made of hard sandstone, and
    was about three feet high. The head was broken off, and had been taken
    away to prevent the Indians from worshipping it. I at first thought
    that the idol must have been made subsequent to the Spanish occupation
    of this part of Mexico, for by the costume it seemed to be intended to
    represent a Spanish cavalier. In front of the waist belt there was a
    small head surmounting a rudely shaped cross.</p>

  <p>It appeared as if the native sculptor had wished to make the image
    of a knight holding before him a head, such as is not infrequently
    seen in early sacred pictures.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But although this was the vague
    impression made upon the mind by an examination of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>front of the
    statue, it was evident upon looking at the reverse side that the date
    of its sculpture was of a much earlier period, for it was covered
    with an upright line of hieroglyphics of the same character as those
    carved upon the idols at Copan. I examined with care the details of the
    figure, and made sketches of the front and back, as I thought that it
    would be useful to preserve a slight memorial of this idol which may
    eventually share the fate of many others and be destroyed.</p>

    <div class="caption">Indian statue. Ocosingo.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Two larger idols were placed against the wall of the church. These
    were also headless. Don Remigio showed me several long stones that
    were used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
    for the door steps at the entrance of some of the largest
    of the huts occupied by Ladinos and which had been taken from the
    ruins. One of these, made of limestone, was covered with deeply carved
    hieroglyphics still quite clear and distinct. In front of one of the
    dwellings there was a flat stone measuring about three feet square. On
    the surface of this stone were two figures. A woman in an imploring
    attitude was presenting a cup to a man, who was standing up and bending
    forward to receive the offering. The wall of an adjoining house was
    partly built with stones also taken from the temples. They had a
    perfectly smooth surface and were each about two feet long, one foot
    wide and two inches thick. Similar stones were scattered about the
    pueblo, and many were used as stepping stones across the stream that
    flowed eastwards to join the waters of the river Usamacinta.</p>

  <p>The church, from its size and manner of construction, had been
    evidently of considerable importance. It was then in ruins and the roof
    had fallen. As there were no funds available for its restoration it was
    deserted.</p>

  <p>The Gefe Politico, who held the appointment in this town and district
    of Civil Governor, spoke to me about an expedition that was under
    consideration, for constructing a road or mule path to connect this
    part of Mexico with the English port of Belize in Honduras. He thought
    that if such a road was practicable it would become the principal
    line for trade, and the ranges of mountains near Tumbalá would be
    avoided. This was to be the primary purpose of the expedition, but
    there were other objects which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
    influenced the minds of the inhabitants
    of Ocosingo. It was thought that the surveyors might make strange
    discoveries in the mysterious and unknown region occupied by the
    Lacandon Indians. Possibly amongst the forests in the sierras, temples
    and hidden treasures might be found; or perhaps a city where the
    ancient ceremonies and sacrifices were still performed.</p>

  <p>The Gefe said that a small band of explorers had lately penetrated
    a few leagues into the forest, and had seen several circular shaped
    huts, but the Indians who lived in them had fled. They found maize and
    tomatoes growing upon the open spaces, but they saw no horses, dogs or
    other animals. He pointed out to me the hills amongst which the wild
    Lacandones lived. It was afterwards suggested that I might take the
    post of leader of the proposed expedition.</p>

  <p>If I had been quite free, with sufficient time at my disposal, I
    should have been much inclined to assist to the best of my power in
    the formation of a preliminary surveying party. I thought that a
    practicable route would be found to connect Ocosingo with the existing
    road leading from Guatemala to Flores, on the lake of Peten, and
    thence to Honduras, and that, in this manner, the distance to Belize
    would be much shortened. The first portion of the survey would have
    to be conducted through a region which is unknown, and possibly many
    interesting facts would be ascertained, and perhaps an ancient ruined
    temple might be discovered.</p>

  <p>Whilst staying at Ocosingo I collected a small vocabulary of the words
    of the local dialect. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
    were nearly the same as those spoken near
    Comitan, and I was surprised to find that Lopez could not carry on a
    conversation with these men. I asked him how this happened and he said
    that the languages (lenguas) were quite different, and that he could
    not speak with the Ocosingos. It seems probable that, in the course of
    time, the construction of the phrases commonly used, or the manner of
    the application of the words must have become changed. Although it is
    only three days’ journey between the two tribes, it is evident that
    there cannot have been much communication between them for several
    centuries.</p>

  <p>As Lopez did not know the country beyond Ocosingo, it was settled that
    he should return to Comitan. I was sorry to part with him. He had
    carried the luggage and provisions, and although a part of the journey
    must have been extremely fatiguing to him he never complained. He
    also showed the utmost zeal in obtaining forage for the mule, and was
    willing and attentive. Don Remigio hired for me a guide named Bito, who
    spoke Spanish and knew the paths as far as Chilon, about eleven leagues
    distant. Bito brought with him a horse, and thus we were able to travel
    at a fair speed. After riding through several leagues of pine forests
    we reached Bachajon in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>Bachajon was a strictly Indian village, for the natives objected to any
    white people or Ladinos settling amongst them. In the Plaza we found
    numbers of Indians congregated together. They differed greatly from
    those that I had hitherto seen both in appearance and dialect. The
    men wore a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
    white cloth folded round the head, and white frocks and
    trousers. The women wore a white frock cut open and square over the
    shoulders, and below this a blue skirt reaching nearly to the feet.
    Their thick black hair was tied back with a strip of bright red cotton.
    Many of the younger women were handsome, but their figures were spoilt
    and bent by the custom of carrying large water jars on the hip. The men
    were of a larger stature than the natives on the Pacific side of the
    Cordilleras, and their skin was of a dark copper colour. Their faces
    were broad, but the cheek bones were not so high as is usual with the
    North American Indians. Their hair was long, black and very thick, and
    their eyes were dark, large, round and restless. With all of them the
    nostrils were very wide.</p>

  <p>The church was in ruins, the roof had entirely disappeared, and only
    the porch and outer walls remained standing. I remained for several
    hours in the Plaza, and my attention was directed to a remarkable
    observance. The Indians, when returning from their fields upon the
    completion of their day’s work, invariably, before going to their
    huts, went to the front of the ruined porch. There they knelt down
    and prayed for some minutes. I was deeply interested in observing the
    practice of this custom. There was something that appealed strongly to
    the imagination in witnessing the simple and earnest devotion of these
    wild, ignorant and uncivilised people. It was impossible to conjecture
    what was present in their minds, as one by one they, in their solitary
    manner, knelt devoutly before these ruined walls. Possibly they
    worshipped in their memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
    the images that, many years before, had
    been enshrined within.</p>

  <p>In the evening, as we approached Chilon, we met hundreds of Indians,
    men and women, all of whom came forward by the side of my mule, and
    inclined their heads saying “Tá” (Padre.) Bito told me that they
    supposed that I was a priest, and that they expected me to follow the
    custom of the priests and put my hand upon their foreheads. As I did
    not wish to sail under false colours, I made an objection to this
    proceeding, but Bito said that if I did not do it the Indians would
    feel distressed, and would not understand why they were treated in an
    unkind manner. He also begged me to do what they wished, or otherwise
    some trouble might arise, as many of the men appeared to be in a
    half-drunken condition.</p>

  <p>At Chilon I was welcomed by the Justicia, to whom I had a letter from
    Don Manuel Cansino. The town was in a state of much excitement. It was
    the commencement of the Carnival, an event which caused a considerable
    degree of anxiety and apprehension in the minds of the officials.
    Processions of Indians, dressed in appropriate costumes, were marching
    through the town, and groups of wild-looking men were dancing to the
    sounds of rudely shaped fifes and hollow wooden drums. In the morning
    these Indians, in accordance with their annual custom, performed a
    dance before the door of each house. These dancers were supposed to be
    dressed like the conquerors. They wore red, slashed doublets, and loose
    white trousers. They carried spears or lances with coloured pennons.
    The scene was bright, gay and picturesque.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

  <p>During the day I discharged Bito, and obtained a guide to accompany me
    to Yajalon. We arrived there about sunset and the Presbitero Fernando
    Macal received me with much kindness and attention. At Yajalon the
    Indians had assembled in great numbers and the Carnival was at its
    height. Here as at Chilon, the performances chiefly consisted of
    processions and dances. There were also horse races in front of the
    cabildo, and one of the most curious scenes was the representation of
    the Spaniards entering a captured city on horseback. The Indians were
    Tzendales of the same race as those at Bachajon and were very wild
    looking men. An important part of the festival consisted in eating as
    great a quantity of food as possible, and drinking copious draughts of
    strong spirits. In the evening there was much drunkenness.</p>

  <p>The Carnival lasted for three days, and during that time I had to
    remain in Yajalon, as no Indian could be found who would willingly
    leave this scene of revelry and excitement. On the second day the
    President called upon me at the convent, and informed me that, in
    his opinion, it would be highly dangerous for a white man who was a
    stranger, to venture out into the open country before the Indians had
    recovered from the effects of the carnival, as, in consequence of their
    known hatred to all white people, it was impossible to say what might
    happen when they were in an excited condition. In anticipation of local
    troubles he had organised a small police force which was employed in
    patrolling the pueblo day and night, for the purpose of preventing any
    quarrels of castes. He had also a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
    company of seventy soldiers prepared
    to act in the event of any serious outbreak. As far as I could judge,
    the Indians, when in a drunken state, were quiet and inoffensive, but
    the President was evidently very anxious about their conduct.</p>

  <p>As I had no share in the responsibility for maintaining good order, the
    strange life and the sounds of drums and fifes and marimbas afforded
    me inexhaustible pleasure and amusement. The pretty dresses of the
    women also added much to the charm of the scene. Many of these Tzendal
    women were very handsome. Their heads were well set upon finely shaped
    throats and shoulders. Their costume consisted of a long white frock
    cut open round their neck, and embroidered with red and yellow squares,
    which had a pleasing effect of colour. But not only was the festival
    attractive from the quaint and novel character of the scene, but it was
    also most enjoyable weather. The skies were blue, the sun was bright,
    and the surrounding hills and valleys formed an agreeable contrast.
    There was perhaps a slight, underlying sense of danger and a doubt as
    to what would occur after sunset, and what might be the effect of the
    subsequent orgies upon the savage natures of these Indians. Possibly
    what began at daylight as a drama might end at night as a tragedy.
    The conduct of the timorous half-caste population or Ladinos was
    remarkable. They were conscious that they were hated by the Indians,
    and consequently they remained within their houses, and kept themselves
    out of sight.</p>

  <p>The dances and processions are said to have been taught by the Spanish
    monks. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
    evident that they usually have some connection with the
    events of the wars between the Spaniards and the Moors, for the Indians
    always speak of these representations under the general name of “los
    Moros.” But they are also mixed up with other subjects which, not
    improbably, have some relation to events that happened before Cortes
    conquered Mexico.</p>

  <p>There was a peculiarity in the Indian character which was noticeable in
    all their proceedings. This was the absence of all conversation amongst
    the numerous spectators. The games, races and processions, the beating
    of the wooden drums and the continuous sounds of the marimbas went
    on incessantly, but there was no other noise and no murmur of human
    voices. The gift of speech with these tribes seems almost unnecessary
    for the purposes of their lives, and the language of signs would
    possibly be sufficient for their requirements.</p>

  <p>The Spaniards in the sixteenth century were astonished by the
    extraordinary debauchery of the Indians during their festivals. The
    events which occurred upon these occasions, especially in Yucatan,
    surprised the soldiers belonging to a nation remarkable for its
    sobriety. The Indians in Cuba, Hayti, and the islands of the Caribbean
    sea, and those inhabiting Florida, the valley of the Mississippi, and
    other parts of North America, had no knowledge of an intoxicating
    spirit. The origin of the excessive insobriety amongst the Mexican
    Indians is clearly traceable to the indigenous growth of the Maguey
    (_Agave Americana_). This aloe grows abundantly in the sterile regions
    of Central America, and supplies a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
    fluid which, after undergoing
    certain preparations, is highly alcoholic.</p>

  <p>At Yajalon, as at Bachajon and Ocosingo, the church was in ruins. There
    was nothing left of it except the bare walls, marks of the old altars
    and parts of the chancel. Long grass was growing over the ground of
    the nave. The convent was also in a ruinous condition and only one
    side of the quadrangle remained. The interior was overgrown with weeds
    and grass, and was used as a pasture for the horses belonging to the
    convent.</p>

  <p>The Presbitero was eloquent upon the subject of the wrongs suffered by
    the Catholics in Mexico, and he particularly dwelt upon the harm that
    had been done to the people in consequence of the decrees which had
    nationalised the possessions of the church, suppressed the convents and
    abolished all religious fraternities. He thought that the withdrawal
    of the monks would have an injurious effect upon the condition of
    the Indians, and that they would gradually relapse into a state of
    ignorance and barbarism. Thus the system begun by Bishop Las Casas,
    and carried on afterwards by monks and priests would come to an end,
    and all their efforts to advance and benefit the aboriginal tribes be
    rendered useless and vain.</p>

  <p>It is difficult at this distance of time to estimate correctly the
    value of the work done by Las Casas, and the consequences of the
    enactments in favour of the Indians, obtained by his appeals to the
    Spanish government. In this diocese of Chiapas his zeal led to the
    establishment of numerous churches and convents. Dominicans and
    brethren of other orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
    came over from Europe for the purpose
    of living amongst these Indians, converting them, educating them
    and forming centres of local civilization. To a certain extent the
    ceremonies of the church, and especially the worship of images, seemed
    to obtain a powerful hold upon the devotional nature of many of the
    tribes, and the monks obtained great influence over them.</p>

  <p>Thus far the work begun by Las Casas unquestionably did much good in
    this and the adjoining provinces. The exhortations of the principal
    authorities of the Church in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
    were also beneficial in moderating the hardships inflicted upon the
    natives by the Spanish landowners. But in advocating the cause of the
    Indians, Las Casas, in the fervour of his zeal, created evils the
    effect of which he could not have foreseen. It was in consequence
    of the measures adopted through the representations of this ardent
    reformer that negro slavery was introduced into America. It was also
    chiefly owing to his efforts that consecutive ordinances was decreed,
    which, although issued with the intention of putting a stop to the
    harsh treatment of the Indians, made it almost impossible to carry on
    successfully the government of New Spain. Thus, by the abolition of
    forced labour, it was found that there was an immediate danger of the
    lands granted to the Spaniards becoming thrown out of cultivation and
    their owners ruined. In no part of New Spain was this danger more to be
    apprehended than in the neighbourhood of La Antigua Guatemala, and in
    the country through which I passed on my way to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span> Santa Cruz del Quiché.
    The lands there were fertile and the farms prosperous. The Indians
    performed labour upon them under fixed rules which, although strict
    and exacting, were not opposed to their previous habits. When these
    regulations were withdrawn the Indians ceased to work. Finally protests
    were made to the government, and it was pointed out that this usage
    of forced labour was not introduced by the Spaniards, but that it had
    previously been practically the base of the tribal administration.</p>

  <p>There was another usage which was stopped by orders from Spain. This
    was the employment of natives as carriers of merchandise. The abolition
    of this system was found to be disadvantageous to the prosperity of the
    country, and it was submitted to the king that it had always been the
    custom amongst the Indians to transport all things by men working as
    porters, for before the arrival of the Spaniards there were no horses
    or other beasts of burden. The practice of personally carrying heavy
    loads still forms part of the habits of all the inferior classes of
    Indians in Central America.</p>

  <p>The restrictions enforced upon the Spanish landowners did not however
    much affect the prosperity of the church, particularly in the more
    remote districts, where the priests and friars devoted themselves to
    the spiritual welfare and education of the natives. At the convents,
    schools were established for boys and, in the chief towns, sisters
    belonging to nunneries in Spain, came across the Atlantic to teach
    the girls. The monks also endeavoured to arrange that the boys upon
    completing their studies, should teach other Indians and thus spread
    education <span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
    amongst them. These exertions which, in their origin,
    seemed to promise well were not subsequently attended with success,
    and the authority of the brethren declined. Finally the declarations
    of Independence, the revolutions, and the establishment of republics,
    dealt a fatal blow to all educational work.</p>

  <p>Amongst the various consequences of the nationalisation of
    ecclesiastical property, it had come to pass that in the country
    parishes, there were no funds available for maintaining the churches in
    repair, and they were all rapidly falling into ruins. The Presbitero
    was convinced, now that the influence of the priests upon the
    characters of the tribes was no longer felt, and the church services
    were not maintained, that the Indians, especially the Tzendales under
    his care, would return to the practice of their ancient idolatries.</p>

  <p>Upon a subject so doubtful as the effect of the teaching of the priests
    upon the minds of the Indians it is difficult to form an opinion.
    In the sixteenth century the Roman Catholic religion appeared to be
    willingly accepted by the natives; but several of the priests that I
    had met and who discussed this question, were in doubt as to whether
    this readiness to conform with the ceremonies had not some vague
    connection with some previous religious customs. The influence of
    the friars also possibly had some relation to the system of Indian
    priesthood before the conquest; for, according to the statements
    of the Spaniards, there was a strange and inexplicable coincidence
    between certain regulations by which they were bound, and those of the
    Franciscans and Dominicans.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

  <p>It was fortunate that during my detention at Yajalon I was the guest of
    a man so well informed and highly educated as the Presbitero Fernando
    Macal. It was an exceptional fate for him to be thus placed in that
    parish, with its numerous detached hamlets, to perform clerical duties
    amongst these intractable tribes. At the convent in the evening, the
    Presbitero usually discussed questions of theology, together with his
    opinions upon the aboriginal and mixed races in Chiapas. The President
    occasionally joined us, but his mind was preoccupied with anxiety about
    the maintenance of order. All the time, both day and night, the pueblo
    was disturbed by the continuous and monotonous sounds of native music.</p>

  <p>On the fourth morning the Carnival was over and a dissipated,
    savage-looking Tzendal named Villafranca appeared at the convent
    wall, and volunteered to act as my guide to Tumbalá and Palenque.
    The necessary arrangements were made to secure the fulfilment of his
    duties. The mule was brought out of the quadrangle and we were soon
    ready to start. I was warned that the paths over the sierras were in a
    bad condition, and that many difficulties would have to be overcome in
    passing through the forests.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> base of the sierra whose summit we had to reach before night, was
    about two leagues from Yajalon. After having ridden that distance I
    expected to see some indications of Tumbalá, but not being able to make
    out anything, I asked Villafranca where it was. He pointed upwards
    towards the sky, and said “En el núbe, (in the cloud) Señor.” In effect
    it was just possible to see the church amongst the clouds which were
    sweeping over the highest ridge of the Cordilleras.</p>

  <p>The greater part of the day was passed in making the ascent, which was
    a steep and continuous rise for over three leagues. In the afternoon,
    when we had attained to a considerable height, we left below us the
    bright and sunny daylight, and entered into the region of cloudland.
    The weather became cold and gloomy, and as we approached Tumbalá it
    was scarcely possible to see our way for we were moving in a dark fog.
    Near the outskirts of the hamlet we passed close to a structure of an
    unusual shape, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
    unlike an oven. I was afterwards informed that it
    was used by Indians in time of sickness and was practically a steam
    bath. The methods of using it were similar to those adopted by many of
    the tribes in North America. The patient finds inside a supply of water
    to generate steam. Heated stones are passed in from outside and these
    he drops into the water. This system is said to be efficacious in the
    disorders to which men living amongst the Cordilleras are subject, and
    which are probably caused by exposure to sudden changes of temperature.
    It was strange to see amongst these remote sierras a practice which
    seemed to establish the fact that there were links connecting these
    Mexican Indians with the Dakotas in North America, the natives of
    Hawaii, and the Maoris in the distant islands of New Zealand.</p>

  <p>When we arrived at the walls of the convent it was evident that there
    was a general state of commotion without and within. Some event had
    happened, the nature of which I was unable to ascertain. The precincts
    were crowded with numerous groups of Indians and Ladinos. The priest
    was living in a large shed. The quadrangle was apparently used as
    a farmyard and was filled with cattle, horses, mules, turkeys and
    fowls, all wandering about at their own free will, and causing an
    indescribable disturbance. The mists were so thick that it was quite
    impossible to make anything out clearly.</p>

  <p>Inside the shed the state of affairs was equally confusing. Men, women
    and children were busily engaged in preparing to pass the night under
    the protection of the roof, and were choosing their sleeping
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> places.
    As it was necessary to find room without delay, I told Villafranca to
    hang my hammock to the rafters as near to the fire as possible. We then
    went out and tethered the mule upon a level open space beyond, which we
    thought to be convenient for the purpose, but the clouds were so dense
    that we could not see what we were doing. After some further trouble,
    supplies of forage and water were obtained, and placed within the
    mule’s reach. We then returned to the shed within which the priest was
    endeavouring to find suitable quarters for his numerous visitors.</p>

  <p>Later in the evening we were joined by a young couple who had just
    been married, and wanted shelter. It happened that there was an Indian
    bedstead available and this together with two extemporized pillows
    was placed at their disposal. When it became night, we sat round the
    fire and cooked our suppers, and then sleeping mats were unrolled and
    spread upon the ground. The Cura placed his mat near the fire, beneath
    my hammock. Amongst the crowd were several young mothers who had
    their infants with them. These little creatures were duly attended to
    and their wants supplied. The mothers then proceeded to roll them up
    tightly in swaddling clothes until only their heads were visible. They
    were afterwards placed in a row against the wall, where they looked
    like diminutive Egyptian mummies, their large round eyes staring at us
    in a most unmeaning manner. When all these various arrangements were
    completed the doors were closed.</p>

  <p>What happened during the night I do not know, but upon awaking in the
    morning I found that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
    was alone and that the shed was empty. All the
    numerous inmates of the previous night had departed. I turned out of
    my hammock and joined the Cura who was walking in front of his ruined
    convent. He said he would accompany me for a few hundred yards to the
    outer edge of the sierra, to look at the world around and beneath us.</p>

  <p>The clouds had disappeared, the sun had risen brightly above the
    eastern horizon, the sky was blue, the air felt pure and exhilarating,
    and the view was magnificent. Not only did we command range upon
    range of these Cordilleras, but there were also extensive views of
    the valleys below us. Beyond, looking northwards, were the savannahs
    and the tropical lowlands near Palenque; and in the far distance the
    sunlight was flashing upon the calm waters of the Laguna de Terminos.</p>

  <p>Near at hand were groups of wild-looking Indians watching our
    movements. The Cura said he believed they belonged to the Maya
    race, and were allied to the tribes that occupied Yucatan. In their
    appearance they were like the Tzendales near Bachajon. They were
    strongly built men, rather low in stature, and very dark in colour;
    their eyes had peculiarly rounded orbits, and their long black hair
    was cut square over the forehead. They spoke a language which sounded
    very rough and abrupt. The Cura observed that the Indians dwelling
    amongst the mountains were daily becoming neglected, and that they
    were left entirely free to follow their own beliefs and customs. In
    consequence of there being no regular stipend for the clergy, it had
    become impossible to maintain a sufficient number
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span> of priests to
    carry out the duties. He had to superintend the parishes at Tumbalá,
    San Pedro, Palenque and the districts around Las Playas, near the
    river Usamacinta, and therefore he could not attend personally to the
    numerous and scattered Indians placed under his charge.</p>

  <p>Upon our return to the convent, Villafranca came to me and reported
    that the mule was ready and that he had got his machete sharpened
    in order to clear away any branches or brushwood that we might find
    to be obstructing the track. He added to his pack some part of the
    weights carried by the mule, as it was necessary that she should be as
    free as possible, to push her way through the woods, and we reduced
    the quantities of food and other necessaries to the lowest amount
    practicable. A young Mexican who was going to the seacoast came with
    us as far as the entrance to the forest. He then told me that he should
    not attempt to go through it with his clothes on, so he stopped and
    stripped to the skin, and tied his clothes up in a bundle which he
    fastened to the top of his head. He was a white man of mixed descent
    and in his action he showed some elements of the nature of his remote
    Indian ancestry. He ran rapidly to the front, plunged into the forest
    like a lithe athletic young savage, and was soon out of sight.</p>

  <p>As it was not possible to ride I dismounted, and we began to descend
    the steep sides of the mountain. It was very hard work. Villafranca
    led the way. I followed close to him, holding the halter at its full
    length, to prevent the mule as she slipped forward from falling upon
    me. This manner of progression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
    was made difficult by the obstinate
    conduct of the mule. She would occasionally attempt to choose her own
    way and go the wrong side of a tree, and as no energy expended in
    trying to get her back was of any use, I had always to yield and to
    follow her round the trunk. Upon one occasion she got away into the
    forest and was nearly lost. The guide at once threw off his pack and
    went after her.</p>

  <p>The instincts of an Indian were apparent in his proceedings. He
    carefully marked every step of his advance through the dense
    undergrowth by cutting down small branches of the trees and placing
    them on the line of his track. He also here and there, but always
    on the left hand side, cut notches in the trees or bent some twigs
    backwards. After a few minutes interval he returned triumphantly with
    the mule, and after this experience I took care not to allow the halter
    to leave my hands again.</p>

  <p>The fatigues of the day were beyond description. I had been prepared
    to expect difficulties from the steepness of the ascents and descents
    and the growth of the underwood, but there were other obstacles which
    were previously unknown. Our track was constantly barred by creepers
    which crossed from tree to tree in festoons like thick ropes. They hung
    loosely in bends and bights in every conceivable shape, but usually
    they swept the ground in semicircles. Others were hanging in graceful
    loops three or four feet above the ground, so that the mule was unable
    to pass under them. There were also miry, swampy places in which the
    mule sometimes sank to an almost dangerous depth. But what I found
    to be the most serious trial was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
    want of ventilation. There was
    absolutely no movement in the air or any sounds of life, and there was
    very little daylight, for the rays of the sun above did not penetrate
    to the ground.</p>

  <p>The forest was dark and gloomy, and the atmosphere most oppressive.
    The want of a proper supply of fresh air to breathe made the journey
    extremely exhausting. After struggling for several hours down the
    rugged slopes of the first mountain, we reached a narrow valley and
    crossed a small stream. We then had to climb up another sierra so
    steep that it required all my available strength to reach the summit.
    From this height there remained another league to be traversed down a
    steep rocky slope to a wide open savannah, upon which was situated San
    Pedro. Towards sunset we arrived at the village and found shelter under
    a shed, within which was installed the official who ruled over the
    district, and who was called the Maestro.</p>

  <p>In the morning I discovered that during the night my guide had
    deserted. Possibly some accident may have happened to him, but in my
    opinion his conduct was a deliberate act of desertion. I reported the
    case immediately to the Maestro, but Villafranca could not be found
    and I never saw him again. It was supposed that he found the work and
    fatigue of the day greater than he had expected, and was not willing to
    make his way on the morrow through the equally dense forests between
    San Pedro and Palenque. If this surmise was correct his view of the
    situation was quite intelligible, but as I did not consider that an act
    of this kind should remain unpunished, I arranged with the Maestro that
    a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
    from me should be dispatched to Yajalon where the man had
    been hired.</p>

  <p>I wrote to the Presbitero Macal an account of the desertion and
    requested him to bring the case to the notice of the alcalde, in order
    that Villafranca should receive a punishment in accordance with the
    custom of the country, and that he should be deprived of his wages
    which had been left in the Presbitero’s charge. I also requested that
    this money should be given to any of his deserving or distressed
    parishioners. In justice however to this Tzendal, it should be noted
    that he did not rob me. I found everything carefully piled up in
    a corner of the shed; saddle, clothes, rug and the remains of the
    provisions sufficient for one day. The mule was safely tethered outside
    the door.</p>

  <p>I was thus placed in a very insecure position and had to rely entirely
    upon my own resources. The hamlet was surrounded in all directions
    by sierras and forests, and I had not the slightest knowledge of the
    mountain passes. With regard to food I could manage very well as I was
    able to make a fire and was prepared to make the provisions last for
    more than one day if necessary, but in other respects I was entirely
    dependent upon the good will of the San Pedro Indians about whom very
    little was known, but who were considered to be untrustworthy.</p>

  <p>The Maestro declared that he would do all that was in his power to
    assist me, and promised that he would get a guide who would go with
    me to Palenque. But he said that he could not find a man at once, and
    that it would be necessary that I should stop in
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> the convent until the
    following day. In some respects I was not sorry to be detained, for I
    was thus enabled to have some spare time to see something of the habits
    of life amongst the inhabitants of this isolated village, so singularly
    placed in the heart of these remote Cordilleras. I observed that the
    Maestro maintained towards those who were placed under his rule a
    dignified and reserved manner. He was supported in his authority by two
    alcaldes, and two alguazils who were Indians elected annually for these
    posts. The alguazils wore suitable dresses and performed regular police
    duties, walking at intervals about the village, carrying long wands of
    office. It was also their custom to visit the Maestro occasionally,
    attend to his wants, and render such personal service as he required.
    In obedience to his directions, they obtained for me supplies of maize
    and water for the mule, and tortillas and beans for myself, and thus I
    was able to cook a tolerable breakfast.</p>

  <p>During the day I wandered amongst the huts within and near the hamlet
    in order to see something of the natives who lived in them and were
    said to follow the ancient customs and habits of domestic life. Near
    the borders of the savannah some Indians were building a large hut and
    I observed a method of construction which, although absolutely the
    reverse of any system that I had previously known, was most suitable
    for their wants. In the first place the roof is built. This when
    completed, looks like an open thatched shed resting upon upright poles.
    The eaves are brought down low, but sufficiently high to enable a man
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
    moderate height to pass under them without stooping. When the roof
    is considered firm and secure, the four walls inclosing the room are
    made. They are usually constructed of crossed laths and sticks, and
    thickly plastered over with a kind of mud which has a good binding
    consistence.</p>

  <p>The walls are raised until they reach within a short distance from the
    slope of the roof, a sufficient space being left for the escape of
    smoke. The size of the hut and the height of the walls are determined
    by the width and slope of roof. A few rough cross poles are placed
    across the top of the walls for the purpose of hanging up any household
    goods, and sometimes at one end some of these poles are placed close
    together so as to form a platform, where bags of maize and other farm
    produce are kept or dried. When the roof is wide and the overhanging
    eaves are low there is an agreeable and well shaded space outside the
    main hut, where the Indians rest during the day.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

  <p>As far as it was possible to judge from a passing observation the
    Indians at San Pedro seemed to be a contented race. They cultivated
    their milpas or corn fields sufficiently to get enough to supply them
    with maize bread and pozole, and at most of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>huts there were fowls
    and a few pigs. The women laboured in some form of household work,
    and much of their time was occupied in grinding the maize to make
    tortillas. At this village, as in others chiefly inhabited by Indians,
    there was an absence of any human sounds. In the interior of the huts,
    as also outside them, all the occupations of life were performed in
    silence. In the evening, when the men returned home from their work,
    there was the same manner of moving about without noise. There appeared
    to be also an absence of all interest in what was happening around
    them, which gave an element of sadness to the scene. Their lives seem
    to be passed in a state of quiet melancholy and listlessness.</p>

  <p>This condition of the Indians is practically the same throughout this
    part of Central America. The problem of existence is worked out in its
    lowest terms. It cannot however be said that they live in want and
    poverty, because they have no wants. They exist, and are apparently
    content to exist, in the state in which they find themselves placed.
    The bare ground, a thatched roof, bedstead, a few mats, some firewood,
    and a small store of maize suffice for the necessities of their lives.
    Their submissive natures assent to these conditions and they seem to
    accept their fate with passive resignation.</p>

  <p>Upon my return to the shed in the evening, I found that it was
    enlivened by the arrival of a busy, loud-voiced Spaniard named Don Pepe
    Ortiz. He informed me that he was travelling from Oaxaca towards the
    coast of the Gulf of Campeachy with a cargo of tobacco. He had with
    him a band of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
    cargadores to carry the bales. He also employed for
    his own personal use a man of great strength to carry him in places
    where he could not ride a mule. The direction of his journey over the
    sierras was for some distance the same as my own, and he proposed that
    we should, without delay, make arrangements for crossing a river which
    occasionally was difficult to pass over. I had not heard that there was
    a stream of any importance in our way, and I asked Don Pepe to do what
    was expedient. Accordingly he sent on an Indian to order several canoes
    to be in readiness for us on the following morning.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Indian Woman Grinding Chocolate, Central America.</div>
  </div>

  <p>At sunrise my new guide José arrived and we all started together. After
    riding about a league we reached the bank of a river, called the San
    Pedro, which we found to be a deep stream about three hundred yards
    wide. The passage was not made without difficulties, chiefly caused by
    the conduct of the mules, when they reached the opposite bank, which
    was very steep. The canoes were in attendance, and I selected one
    which seemed to be convenient for the moderate weights to be carried.
    The mule was fastened by the halter to the stem of the canoe, and
    swam across with ease, but she obstinately refused to go on shore at
    the proper landing place, and consequently, after several unavailing
    attempts, I allowed her to go free and choose for herself. She swam
    down with the current for about a hundred yards, and then with much
    good judgment she selected her own spot and scrambled safely up the
    bank.</p>

  <p>After having successfully accomplished my crossing,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>I watched the
    movements of Don Pepe and his men in their canoes. It was a picturesque
    scene, but it was within two hours of midday before we were all
    established on the northern side of the river. We then commenced the
    dreaded ascent about which many warnings had been given to me. It was
    a steep climb for five long leagues and it was nearly sunset when we
    reached the summit. We stopped for the night in a small shed which
    sheltered us from the dew.</p>

  <p>Don Pepe’s Indians arrived after us and insisted upon lighting a large
    fire just outside the hut, with the object they said of keeping away
    tigers, and kept it burning like a bonfire as long as it was dark. At
    daylight José and myself and mule began the descent of the opposite
    slope of the sierra. I had been told that we should find this part of
    the journey very arduous, but it exceeded in difficulty anything that I
    had imagined.</p>

  <p>The track, or opening through the trees had almost disappeared, and
    we had to make our own way between detached masses of sharp, angular
    rocks. Frequently it was necessary to scramble over them or to slide
    down them, and it occasionally seemed to me that we were going at
    random down the side of the mountain. But what made our progress more
    than usually difficult was the fact that, in several places, decaying
    trunks of large trees had fallen across our path, and as it was not
    practicable to get the mule over them, we were obliged to diverge into
    the forest to pass round them. When it was thus necessary to quit our
    line of direction, José would instantly draw his machete and mark
    our movements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
    by cutting down branches, so as to secure the means
    of retreat to our starting point, in case we failed to find the path
    again. I was quite aware of the importance of this action. It was
    astonishing to find how in a few seconds in a dense forest and amongst
    thick growth of underwood and creepers all knowledge of direction seems
    to be lost.</p>

  <p>The length of this precipitous descent was a little more than five
    miles, and we took four hours to accomplish the distance. During that
    time I never saw a glimpse of the sky, although I knew that, above the
    trees, the sun was shining brilliantly.</p>

  <p>In the forenoon we reached the banks of the Nopá, which ran at the
    base of the sierra, and halted there to rest. We then passed over the
    river, and pushed or cut our way through two leagues of dense forest
    and thick brushwood. There were also several small streams with low but
    steep and slippery banks that had to be crossed. Finally we reached and
    forded the river Michol. The worst was then over, and we emerged from
    the forest and saw before us a savannah where we decided to encamp. I
    obtained a slight shelter under the sloping roof of a little open hut,
    which had been left there by some passing Indians. Thus ended a most
    fatiguing day.</p>

  <p>Don Pepe and his Indians arrived after sunset and encamped near us. The
    methods adopted by these Indians when preparing to pass the night upon
    an open savannah were instructive. In the first instance they placed
    upon the ground a quantity of broad dry leaves to protect them from the
    damp grass. They then dispersed, and in a few minutes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> the adjacent
    forest resounded with the noise of the blows made by their machetes.
    They returned bearing loads of firewood and also several strong forked
    branches. These they sharpened at one end and fixed into the earth
    near the camping place to form supports to carry the bales of tobacco.
    In this manner the cargo was raised about three feet, and thus they
    carried out the invariable rule of Indians who never leave anything
    upon the ground at night. They then lighted a large fire.</p>

  <p>There were characteristics with respect to these Oaxaca Indians, which
    I had already observed on the previous day, but which more particularly
    came under my notice upon this occasion. They had gone through a long
    day’s work of most severe labour, and yet upon settling down for
    the night’s rest they neither ate any food or drank any water. My
    guides, who were not, like these men, trained to carry great weights
    for considerable distances, were also able to live upon very small
    quantities of food and never seemed to be tired at the end of the day’s
    journey.</p>

  <p>It was the custom of each Indian before leaving his home to provide
    himself with a small quantity of a substance called pozole, which was
    prepared for him by his wife. This was usually made in the following
    manner. A sufficient quantity of maize was partly boiled, until the
    grain could be easily removed from the husks. These softened grains
    were then ground upon the metatl or grindstone until a thick paste was
    made. This was either put into a little bag or rolled up in a green
    leaf. This paste was the principal part of the food that was carried,
    but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
    sometimes the wives gave their husbands a supply of tortillas. To
    make these, the grains of maize, after being slightly boiled, are put
    upon the metatl, and rolled out into a very thin pancake; this is taken
    off the stone and put upon a large leaf and made into a round shape.
    It is then placed upon a pan and held for a few minutes over the fire,
    until it is properly baked, when it becomes a tortilla. With a few of
    these and his scant store of pozole an Indian always considers himself
    to be amply provisioned until he returns to his village or secluded
    country hut.</p>

  <p>My guides took their principal meal about noon. A portion of the paste
    was taken out of the leaf and placed upon the palm of the left hand, a
    small quantity of water was then mixed with it until it became slightly
    fluid and then it was eaten. In the evening they usually took more
    pozole and a tortilla, after which they would drink some water mixed
    with enough of the pozole to make it become the colour and consistency
    of thin milk. In this manner they avoided drinking pure cold water.
    This was the daily food of my Indians, upon which they could go long
    journeys carrying considerable weights, and they never appeared to be
    tired.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

  <p>The cargadores are trained from boyhood to carry heavy burdens over
    great distances. Don Pepe expected them to travel eight leagues a day.
    But <span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
    when carrying lighter loads they will sometimes travel for several
    consecutive days at the rate of nearly forty English miles a day. When
    the cargo-bearers were moving in single file with their burdens, they
    looked like the Tamemes bearing tribute to Montezuma as represented
    in the ancient pictures. It is probable that these men were enduring
    labours similar to those that had been performed by their ancestors for
    centuries before the arrival of the Spaniards.</p>

  <p>In the morning the Indians proceeded on their journey towards the
    coast. We followed a path leading in another direction, through open
    and wooded lowlands. Finally after a ride of four leagues we reached
    the savannah upon which is situated the village of San Domingo del
    Palenque.</p>

  <p>Never have I known a moment of more keen pleasure and satisfaction,
    than that when José pointed out to me this beautiful spot. I had become
    fatigued by the hardships of the previous days, and the buoyancy
    of mind that was felt in getting at last into a region of life and
    sunshine cannot be adequately expressed.</p>

  <p>We stopped to ask where Doctor Coller lived, and were shown the
    position of a low, thatched cottage, at the door of which stood the
    only European living in the village.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> I was received by him with
    friendly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
    welcome. My hammock was placed under the shade of the
    projecting thatch. The mule was set free to wander at will amongst the
    plains, and I was advised to take twenty-four hours complete rest. On
    the following forenoon I made arrangements for proceeding to the ruins,
    and a few Indians were sent there to open the path, and to clear the
    inner courts of the palace from weeds and brushwood.</p>

  <p>San Domingo del Palenque is placed upon a rising grassy slope studded
    with fine trees. The church was in ruins and roofless. The population
    consisted chiefly of Ladinos. The Indians lived in secluded places near
    the outskirts, where they cultivated their milpas or cornfields. There
    was a charm about this sunny fertile savannah and the simple habits of
    life of its inhabitants, which must be attractive to men of sensitive
    temperaments. The land is fertile, corn is abundant, and cattle, horses
    and mules wander over the green pastures in freedom.</p>

  <p>It was an unusual series of circumstances that had caused Dr. Coller to
    settle for life in this remote part of the world. He told me that he
    was a native of Switzerland and was born at Zurich. He was educated in
    that city but completed his studies at Berlin. Much of his early life
    was passed in different countries. About ten years before my arrival,
    he felt a wish to see Palenque and found his way to this region from
    the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. Upon reaching the village he was
    fascinated by its beautiful situation, its repose and its proximity to
    the ancient ruins in which he felt the strongest interest. He found
    that the life at San Domingo had an attraction for him which he did
    not wish to resist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
    and he decided to make this place his home, and
    married a native who possessed, in her own right, some land in the
    neighbourhood.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

  <p>Dr. Coller was a man of varied and extensive information and an
    excellent linguist. He had devoted much time, not only to the
    investigation of the Indian antiquities, but also to the study of the
    geology and botany of the district, and I was much pleased when he
    proposed to accompany me to Palenque. It was of the greatest advantage
    thus to have the benefit of his accurate knowledge of the positions of
    the mounds and temples.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a bright tropical morning when we mounted our horses and
    followed the narrow path leading to Palenque. After riding for a league
    through woods, savannahs, and cornfields, we reached and crossed the
    river Michol.</p>

  <p>As we approached the ruins, the forest was so thick that we were not
    able to see anything beyond the track which had been cleared for us by
    our men. At a distance of about three Spanish leagues from San Domingo,
    we came to the borders of a small running stream. Dr. Coller stopped
    and said that at this point we should dismount, as we had arrived at
    our destination. We then went up a steep slope, on the summit of which
    I could see dimly, the pillars and ruined roof of the “Palace.”</p>

  <p>Our Indians met us at the entrance. They had already cleared the
    brushwood which had overgrown the quadrangles, and had removed all that
    interfered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
    with any exploring work that they thought we might wish
    to carry out. The luxuriance of the vegetation was surprising. In one
    of the open courts we observed a large plant which we found to be a
    species of arum. The leaves were of an extraordinary size, and averaged
    four feet six inches long by three feet six inches wide; the stalks
    were over seven feet high.</p>

  <p>The greater part of the day was occupied in making a survey of the
    ground plans of the building, as far as it was possible to trace them
    amongst the accumulations of fallen ruins. Upon the completion of this
    work, and after having made an examination of the series of small
    chambers below the corridors, it became evident that the building
    was erected with the intention of establishing a monastery, similar
    to those which were described by the historians of the conquest of
    Mexico as being dedicated to the use of the priests who worshipped
    and performed ceremonies at the shrines of the god Quetzalcoatl, and
    who, in addition to those duties, were given the charge of educating
    the children of the chiefs. They also trained those youths who were
    intended to become priests.</p>

  <p>It is to be regretted that this great structure was called by its first
    discoverers “The Palace,” and that its purpose was rendered perplexing
    by theories connected with the dwellings of Kings or Caciques.</p>

  <p>According to the investigations of Mr. Stephens, its extreme dimensions
    were two hundred and twenty-eight feet long, by one hundred and eighty
    feet wide. The height of the rectangular mound upon which it is placed
    has been variously estimated. It appears to have been about twenty
    feet high.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
    Upon the summit of this platform was built with stone and
    mortar, the various foundations upon which the buildings and galleries
    of the monastery were erected. The base upon the east front was about
    ten feet high. The height of the building may be estimated to have been
    nearly twenty-four feet. Thus it may be concluded that the whole height
    from the ground to the roof must have been approximately fifty-four
    feet. The architectural proportions seem to have been well designed.</p>

  <p>The interior gave me the impression of being Moorish in its style,
    especially with respect to the open inner courts, the arrangement
    of the corridors and the lavish employment of stucco ornamentation,
    brilliantly coloured. A closer investigation into architectural details
    left the subject in doubt, but there still remained upon the mind the
    feeling that in some unintelligible manner, the construction had been
    directed either by foreigners or by Indians who were partly descended
    from men of foreign origin. The forms of ancient mosques and of the
    inner courts and quadrangles of Arabian or Moorish and Spanish public
    buildings were indistinctly recalled to the memory. It was however to
    be observed, upon an examination of the methods adopted at Palenque
    in supporting the weight of the roofs, that the arches (if it is
    permissible for that term to be applied to straight converging slopes
    covered with flat coping stones,) are absolutely exceptional and unlike
    any other arch that is known. I was reminded, to a certain extent, of
    the ruins of Alatri, near Mycenæ on the plains of Argos, and of an
    Etruscan tomb near Perugia, but the system employed by the American
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
    architects, in placing the cap or terminal cross stones was essentially
    different.</p>

  <p>In the exploration of the ruins our attention was chiefly directed
    to certain doubtful points, particularly with regard to the chambers
    which are beneath the corridors, and are entered from the level of the
    courts. There have been several conjectures respecting the purposes
    of these cells. I think that it is probable that they were used as
    dormitories. In some of the chambers there was a low, wide stone table,
    placed against the wall at the end. These benches were large flat
    smooth slabs of limestone supported on four stone legs. In height,
    shape and dimensions they were like the wooden bedsteads used by the
    Indians at the present time.</p>

  <p>There is a square tower in one of the inner courts which must be
    considered as the most singular structure in Palenque. In position and
    manner of construction it is abnormal in character. It was probably
    intended for some special object, after the monastery had been
    completed. When Captain Del Rio saw this tower, in 1787, he estimated
    its height to be sixteen yards. In 1870 there were heaps of rubble
    and fallen stones piled against the base, which made it difficult for
    me to make exact measurements, but an approximate estimate gave the
    sides of the square near the base as twenty-three feet, and the height
    about forty-five feet. The peculiarity about the construction is the
    fact that it consists of a tower within a tower. The inner structure
    contains a steep and narrow staircase. Light is obtained through large
    openings in the sides of the outer tower, and then through
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span> smaller
    openings in the walls of the interior one. The steps appear to have
    led up to the top. The walls are formed of rough slabs of limestone
    which had been thickly coated over with cement, portions of which
    still remained. It was raised to a height which commanded views of the
    adjacent temples.</p>

  <p>Upon my return to the eastern front, I found that the Indians had
    slung the hammocks in the outer corridor overlooking the forest. A
    few minutes before sunset we heard the strange and beautiful notes of
    a solitary bird singing amongst the ruins. The song resembled in its
    tone that of a thrush. Dr. Coller said that the bird was a kind of
    nightingale, and that it was only known to live within and around the
    Palenque temples. The bird sang in a slow, deliberate manner, each of
    the notes having a short interval of time between them. The song was
    maintained during the twilight, and ceased as soon as it became dark
    and the night had begun. It was an evening hymn to the setting sun.
    The hoarse screams and movements of troops of monkeys then disturbed
    the precincts. These harsh noises gradually stopped, and as the
    night advanced the forest became silent. The moon was up and we knew
    that it was shining brightly above the trees, but we could only see
    occasionally its faint glimmer. I had expected to hear the croaking of
    frogs or the sounds of cicadas, the usual accompaniment to a tropical
    evening, but although there was a running stream of water at the foot
    of the mound, these familiar sounds were absent.</p>

  <p>The brushwood covering the ground was made brilliant by numerous
    fireflies. The light which shone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
    from these beetles far exceeded
    anything of that nature that I had seen in other regions, and I took
    the opportunity of ascertaining the strength of the illuminating power.
    I sent one of the men into the wood to catch the largest firefly
    that he could find, and then, after having made the corridor dark by
    extinguishing our candles, the insect was held about two inches from a
    blank page of my note book, Dr. Coller watched the experiment. We found
    that the light was steady and shed a soft clear phosphorescent glow
    over the paper. The luminous power was sufficient to enable us to read
    or write with ease over a surface two inches square. After writing a
    few notes upon what had been done during the day we added:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="hang">“Written by the light of a firefly in the Palace, in the ruins
      of Palenque, the night of Wednesday, March 10th, 1870, the
      candle (firefly) held by Dr. Albert Coller. The light about
      equal to that of a small wax candle and very pure. The light
      rather greenish.”</p>

    <p class="right">“Dr. <span class="smcap">A. J. Coller</span>.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Before turning into my hammock I visited the horses tethered at the
    base of the mound near the stream. They were much worried by flies,
    mosquitos, and small ticks called garrapátas, which find their way
    under the skin and cause great irritation. In the corridor, thirty
    feet above them, we were not troubled with any of these pests, but
    there were numerous bats. The Indians said that, sometimes, horses were
    seriously injured by bats biting them above their hoofs.</p>

  <p>In the morning, upon the earliest indications of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> dawn, the solitary
    nightingale again began its song, and the clear staccato, and
    singularly musical note was again heard amongst the ruins until
    sunrise, when it ceased. Thus this bird sang its song of praise as the
    herald of the day.</p>

  <p>At sunrise Dr. Coller returned to San Domingo, leaving me alone at
    Palenque to carry out the investigation of the mounds and temples, a
    work which he thought would be laborious and oppressive. My guides
    were however well acquainted with the ruins, and I consequently
    knew that I should be spared all unnecessary exertion. But until I
    began the exploration I had no idea of the difficulties that had to
    be encountered. The men were employed in cutting a path through the
    brushwood and it was impracticable to do more than follow a certain
    line of direction and obtain ideas of distances by counting the
    number of paces or by noting intervals of time. I soon ascertained
    that with the means at my disposal it was hopeless to expect to do
    more than obtain a general knowledge of the extent and form of the
    chief structures, and the positions of the mounds. It was a serious
    disappointment to find that it was impossible to make a thorough
    examination without the aid of a large number of Indians to cut down
    the trees and clear the ground. This would have been a work involving
    much time and expenditure and was entirely beyond my power. The forest
    was sombre, for the light that penetrated through the trees, was
    insufficient. It was however possible to obtain a fair knowledge of the
    extent of the space covered by the mounds, and their distances from the
    monastery. The ground plan of the inclosure could also be approximately
    understood.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

  <p>The first and, with respect to its altar, the most important building
    that I saw, was that known by the name of the Temple of the Cross.
    Before ascending the sides of the mound upon which it stands, I
    examined the formation of an ancient causeway which covered, for some
    distance, the stream near its base. I traced it for about one hundred
    and fifty yards. A small portion was sufficiently preserved to enable
    the system of construction to be ascertained. It appears to have been
    intended for the purpose of confining the rivulet that ran beneath it,
    and thus to secure a dry roadway, or crossing, during the rainy season.
    It was stated by the Indians, that there still existed, in the forest,
    the remains of a stone bridge. As far as I could understand their
    description, it appeared that in shape it was not unlike the ancient
    Chinese bridges, and rose to the centre by steep gradients.</p>

  <p>After finishing the measurements of the causeway we began to ascend
    the mound. About halfway up the slope, the men stopped and pointed to
    a place where, lying with its face on the ground, was the stone of
    the cross. As this tablet had been the subject of much investigation,
    and is undoubtedly, with respect to its meaning, the most remarkable
    monument at Palenque, I was anxious to examine it with the utmost care.
    I directed the Indians to turn it over and thoroughly clean it from
    moss and dirt, so as to enable me to make a sketch of it. I found that,
    in consequence of the action of the earth upon the face of the stone,
    parts of the sculpture were difficult to trace, but the central figures
    were quite distinct. I was able to make a satisfactory outline,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
    chiefly confining my attention to the cross, the bird surmounting it,
    and the dress of the man, having in his hands what seemed to be a
    child, which he was presenting as a votive offering.</p>

  <p>The bird, with its long double tail feathers, was probably the
    representation of the Quetzal, the sacred bird of the Quichés, and
    thus it may be assumed that the temple in which this tablet formed the
    centre of the altar-piece, was dedicated to the worship of the god
    Quetzalcoatl. But, judging by the peculiarities of the dress worn by
    the principal worshipper, I formed the opinion that he was not, as has
    previously been supposed, a priest offering sacrifice. The worshippers
    and the offerings have, I believe, other significations.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

  <p>The temple, placed upon the top of the mound, must have been—when it
    was externally perfect—a graceful and well proportioned shrine; but
    when I saw it, the outer walls were so enveloped in brushwood and
    enclosed by trees, that it was not practicable to do more than obtain
    a conception of its proportions. After having measured the length,
    breadth and height, and made a ground plan, I examined the interior.
    A corridor ran along the front; within was the chamber which had
    contained the inscribed stone slabs which formed the back of the altar,
    in the centre of which had been the figure of the cross. This, and the
    right and left hand tablets, had been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
    all closely joined together so
    as to form one subject,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the meaning of which was probably explained
    by the hieroglyphic characters. The right hand tablet, which had been
    removed, I had already seen at the museum in Washington.</p>

  <p>After leaving this sanctuary, we descended the southern slope until
    we reached the base, and then began to ascend the adjoining mound, on
    whose summit was another temple. Thus we proceeded until we reached a
    singular little structure which has been considered to be exceptional,
    from the fact that the figure upon the altar had been placed upon a
    base supported by what are supposed to have been two tigers. I could
    only trace the remains of the feet, as everything within and without
    the temple was in ruins. Following the direction of the quadrangular
    precincts, we finally crossed over an unusually lofty mound, and then
    arrived at the back or western face of the monastery.</p>

  <p>We had completed a slight survey of the mounds and temples on the sides
    of the inclosure, having passed successively over them and examined the
    altars, as far as their more or less ruined state permitted. These all
    varied in their dimensions, but they were evidently built for analagous
    purposes as shrines for the worship of the Indian gods.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> There
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>was,
    however, one important exception which requires to be noticed.</p>

  <p>At the south-west angle of the monastery—and connected with it in such
    a manner that it seems to have been an adjunct to the main building—are
    the ruins of a structure which has been considered to have been a
    temple, but which, I think, served for a different purpose. It stands
    upon a mound about forty-five feet high. Its frontage was found to be
    longer than that of any of the other temples. In the interior there
    was no altar, but the upright slabs of stone placed upon the inner
    wall were covered with hieroglyphs. When the Indians, who accompanied
    Mr. Stephens, saw these groups of characters they declared that the
    building was an escuela or schoolhouse. Other opinions were also given,
    but the subject has not received any investigation. I think it is
    probable that the opinion of the Indians was correct, and that it was
    here that the boys were taught the meaning of the hieroglyphic symbols,
    and were thus able to read and interpret the signs placed upon the
    idols and altars.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon we re-entered the monastery. We had been for nearly
    seven hours occupied in crossing over the mounds and clearing a path
    through the forest, and yet at no time did I estimate that we were more
    than five hundred yards from our starting point. At the end of this
    part of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
    the day’s work, I found that I was able to establish some
    deductions respecting the positions and heights of the raised platforms
    and the character of the stone edifices.</p>

  <p>It may be concluded that Palenque consists of a group of mounds having
    buildings upon them exclusively devoted to the purposes of religion.
    In the year 1840, five of the mounds had temples upon their summits
    which were in a fair state of preservation. The survey of Captain
    Antonio Del Rio was made in the year 1787, and, as he was an officer
    of the Artillery, his Report, with respect to the general plan, and
    the bearings and distances of the mounds then remaining, may be
    accepted as being correct. He states that he visited the ruins called
    Casas de Piedras (stone houses) on the 5th of May, and finding that
    nothing could be distinctly made out in consequence of the forest,
    he engaged a large number of Indians from Tumbalá, who felled the
    trees and afterwards cleared the ground by fire, thus opening up a
    sufficient space to enable him to observe the true positions of the
    mounds and buildings. He found that they were all contained within a
    rectangular area, four hundred and fifty yards long and three hundred
    yards wide. In the centre was the mound upon which stood the largest
    structure. This was surrounded by other edifices, “namely: five to the
    northward, four to the southward, one to the south-west, and three to
    the eastward.”</p>

  <p>Thus it appears that in 1787 there were thirteen mounds with buildings
    upon their summits, besides the large platform earthwork upon which
    was placed the “Palace.” In 1806, nearly twenty years afterwards,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>the
    Spanish Government ordered another survey to be made. The expedition
    was placed under the orders of Captain Dupaix, who had served as
    an officer in the Dragoons. He reported that, at that time, eleven
    temples were still standing. Thirty-four years later, Mr. Stephens
    could only discover five temples not utterly ruined. It is strange that
    in these short intervals of time, such changes should have happened
    amongst monuments of this nature. With regard to this subject, it is
    of consequence to notice the statements given by the local authorities
    who made the original discoveries which led to the survey of Del Rio.
    The explorations were conducted, under the orders of the Spanish
    authorities at Guatemala, by one of the principal inhabitants of
    the village of San Domingo, named Calderon, aided by the Government
    architect, Bernasconi. In their Report, which was made only three years
    before that of Del Rio, they declared that there were evidences of the
    ruins of numerous houses occupying a large space of land to the west
    of the temples. Nothing was known by my Indians upon this subject. It
    should, however, be observed, with respect to undiscovered ruins, that
    any rumours relating to what may, or may not, exist in the heart of a
    tropical forest, must necessarily be doubtful, for where nothing can be
    seen, except what may happen to be found in the direction of the path,
    much must be unknown.</p>

  <p>On the slopes of the ground in front of one of the temples I saw a
    large and rudely carved statue, which in consequence of its form
    and manner of sculpture is of much importance. There is reason to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
    believe that it was intended to represent Quetzalcoatl, an Indian god,
    a mythical or real personage, who, for many reasons connected with
    Palenque, requires to have an especial consideration given to him. It
    is a distinctive characteristic of this statue, that the features are
    essentially different from those of the Indians whose figures are to be
    seen upon the altars of the temples and within the courts and corridors
    of the monastery. These have receding foreheads and sharply defined
    prominent faces, quite unlike the present races in Central America, but
    in a marked degree resembling the tribes of the North American Indians,
    who had the custom of flattening the heads of their children.</p>

  <p>The statue by my measurement, was a few inches more than eight feet in
    height, exclusive of the lower part of the stone, which tapered off in
    such a manner as to show that it had been originally placed upright and
    fixed in the ground. The feet stood on a base upon which was carved the
    hieroglyph which probably denoted the name. The forehead was low and
    straight. The face was completely different in type and expression,
    from that of any known race of Indians. The head was surmounted by a
    kind of high tiara. The left hand held in front of the figure a small
    head, in the same position as in the little figure at Ocosingo.</p>

  <p>As, after completing the circuit of the mounds, there were still a few
    hours at my disposal before leaving Palenque so as to reach the village
    before nightfall, I decided to devote the time to the investigation of
    certain problems regarding the age and construction of the buildings.
    But in the first place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
    attention should be directed to the manner in
    which the open courts within the monastery are disposed, and access is
    obtained to the rooms beneath the corridors. Commencing from the east
    front, there are two ranges of corridors which are separated throughout
    their whole length by a strong wall, which receives the thrust of the
    two inner slopes supporting the roof. There is only one entrance or
    means of communication between them in the existing northern portion
    of the ruins. The interior width of each of these galleries is about
    seven feet four inches. After passing across them, the principal
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> court
    is reached and the floor of the open space is seen ten feet below.
    A wide flight of large and well hewn stone steps leads down to the
    bottom, which appears to have been paved with several layers of cement.
    This court is twenty-eight paces wide. The rooms are entered through
    doorways in the sides of the inclosing walls. Opposite to the first
    flight of steps there are similar steps leading to a second series of
    corridors. Passing through these, another court is reached, and beyond
    is the outer gallery which runs along the western side of the building.
    The total width of this cross section of the monastery is approximately
    one hundred and seventy-six feet.</p>

   <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_311"><img src="images/i_311.jpg" width="214" height="450" alt="" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>When wandering amongst these courts, and looking at the vestiges of
    an unknown state of civilisation, I endeavoured to form conclusions
    with regard to the purpose and antiquity of all that was seen. The
    problem is difficult to solve. It has been surmised that the temples
    of Palenque were erected during a period not exceeding four centuries
    before the Spanish conquest. This opinion was based upon what has been
    observed with respect to the condition of the ruins, and the freshness
    of portions of the colouring of the stucco. This method of estimating
    comparative antiquity presents some local difficulties.</p>

  <p>The square tower was originally faced with thick cement, and then
    covered with washes of colour, in the same manner as the walls of the
    Teocallis in the Quiché city of Utatlan upon which the faded colours
    are still visible. If the existing outer coating was the only one that
    had been given it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
    be reasonable to infer that the age of the
    tower was not great. But it happens that in those places where portions
    of the stucco have fallen, there have been numerous applications
    of colour, and therefore admitting that the latest may look bright
    and fresh, it is not possible to estimate the periods that may have
    elapsed between the dates of successive layers. Although I was at first
    inclined to think that the building could not be ancient, yet a more
    careful examination left the subject indeterminate. Any conclusions
    which may have been thought probable on account of the state of the
    walls and roofs are equally uncertain. With regard to this matter it is
    necessary to take into consideration certain existing conditions.</p>

  <p>Immediately behind the ruins are the slopes of the sierras which
    I traversed on the way from Tumbalá. They are covered with loose
    fragments of the limestones of which they are formed. These were the
    building materials used by the architects of the temples. Their small
    size and flat surface were suitable for the purpose, when combined with
    mortar, the mixing of which the Indians well understood. The walls of
    the monastery were made with layers of these flat stones bound together
    with quantities of this mortar. The outer faces were carefully arranged
    to receive a thick casing of cement, which was so hard and sound, that
    it is evident the builders must have had an accurate knowledge of the
    best proportions of the substances required for its composition. The
    cement had a smooth surface and in several places it was still perfect.
    The colours laid upon it are red, blue, yellow and white.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span> They appear
    to have been made more or less vivid and varied in accordance with what
    was thought necessary to obtain good contrasts. The stucco figures and
    scrolls were skilfully designed, and were coloured in a manner which
    was harmonious and effective. The sound state of the cement where
    it is sheltered from the action of the rain is extraordinary. It is
    strange that in this tropical climate where, for half the year there
    are continuous and heavy rainfalls, the variations from the damp, close
    atmosphere in the summer to the dry season of winter should not have
    had a more destructive influence upon buildings, mainly composed of
    rubble and mortar.</p>

  <p>In one instance, that of the tower, the astonishing growth of tropical
    vegetation has had the effect of preventing its fall. Thick creepers
    have wound themselves like strong ropes around the walls and bound
    them firmly together. The walls at the corners of the entrances to the
    courts were remarkably uninjured. The cement was intact, and this, even
    in positions where it might have been expected that, in a long course
    of time, in consequence of being partly exposed and partly sheltered,
    it would have broken away and fallen.</p>

  <p>It would be justifiable to conclude from these evidences of stability
    that the buildings are comparatively modern. But there is a difficulty
    with regard to this assumption which has to be considered. In the
    year 1525, when Cortes on his march from Mexico to Honduras passed
    with his expeditionary forces within a few leagues of this place, the
    temples had been already abandoned. Consequently not less than four
    centuries must have now elapsed since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
    Palenque was deserted. If then,
    within the tropics, buildings made of such perishable materials have
    remained for that long period in a fair state of preservation, it may
    be inferred that there are some local circumstances which have caused
    an exceptional power of resistance to the disintegrating action of the
    climate. The forest may have afforded some protection, and therefore
    the age of the monastery may be greater than might be estimated from
    the condition of the ruins.</p>

  <p>There are, however, other facts which are opposed to any theories
    of great antiquity. The Indians had cleared, for my inspection, the
    stone steps leading from the western side of the principal court.
    Upon these were carved groups of hieroglyphs which were in an almost
    perfect state. The edges of the steps were unworn. It was therefore
    made evident that in an open court, completely exposed to the weather
    and the influence of the tropical rains, inscriptions graven upon the
    surface of these flat stone slabs had remained uninjured.</p>

  <p>After looking at the sculptures, and the coloured stucco figures which
    adorned the piers and inner walls, I endeavoured to establish some
    standard of comparison by which I might be able to form well-founded
    conjectures regarding their age. I thought of various ruins in Egypt
    and Asia Minor, then of those belonging to later periods in Italy
    and Great Britain, but there were such essential differences in the
    materials used, and the influences of the atmosphere, that it was not
    possible to establish any assured conclusions. Opinions formed upon
    the results of an examination of the temples on the mounds
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span> would
    be equally unsatisfactory, for some of them, especially in their
    interiors, were in a comparatively good condition, others were in
    ruins. But, there are proofs of a moderate antiquity. The lintels
    that once supported the walls over the doorways and other openings
    have completely disappeared. In only one instance, which came under
    my notice, were there any signs of the thick, hard beams of zapote
    wood which had been employed for that purpose. A broad lintel in the
    monastery had left its impress upon the under surface of the wall which
    had weighed downwards upon it. The marks of the fibre and the shape
    of the lintel were clearly defined upon the mortar. Dr. Coller found
    amongst the ruins a piece of this wood. It was exceedingly heavy and
    close-grained, and was of the nature of what is known, in the East
    Indies, by the name of iron wood. The zapote trees grow chiefly in the
    forests in the valley of the Usamacinta and towards the lake of Peten.</p>

  <p>When the evening drew near, I called my Indians together and entered
    the forest on the way back to the village. As I rode slowly forward
    I felt that these mysterious ruins contained a secret which has yet
    to be unravelled. The priests of a powerful race, having strange and
    unknown forms of religion, had been for centuries worshipping at these
    shrines. Within the sanctuaries were graven upon tablets of stone those
    records which, when interpreted, may throw some light upon what is now
    obscure.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> San Domingo Dr. Coller showed me a chart which he had drawn of
    the country around for a distance of twelve miles, exclusive of the
    neighbourhood of Palenque where the forest prevented him from making a
    survey. Upon this chart he had placed the positions of eleven mounds
    that he had discovered. They were situated near the left bank of the
    Usamacinta. On the slopes of these mounds were loose slabs of worked
    limestone which he thought must have formed part of houses built on
    their summits. Some excavations had been made and it was proved that
    the mounds were not burial places.</p>

  <p>I met in the village the proprietor of a small hacienda near Balancan.
    He told me that in one of his fields there was a large mound forty feet
    high, which must have had a building upon it, for on the top there
    were large blocks of squared stone. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
    wished to know what the mound
    contained and had therefore dug through it, but he found nothing but
    a curved grindstone precisely similar in shape and size to those now
    used by the women in the neighbourhood. In the adjoining land he had
    found near the surface numerous terra-cotta idols, but he had not seen
    any human bones. It is a coincidence perhaps of some importance, with
    reference to the origin of the race once occupying Palenque, that a
    grindstone was also the only thing found within the mound opened by
    the orders of Carrera on the plains of Mixco, in that part of Central
    America which, before the conquest, had been occupied by the Quichés.</p>

  <p>San Domingo is occasionally visited by groups of the wild Indians
    called Lacandones who live isolated amongst the adjacent forests.
    Dr. Coller told me that during his ten years’ residence, he had seen
    several of these men enter the village for the purpose of exchanging
    beans, tobacco and wax for spirits and other goods. They were always
    dressed in long white cotton frocks which reached nearly to their feet,
    and they wore their hair loose and very long. They seemed to be of a
    shy and inoffensive disposition. It is probable that they are of the
    same tribe as the Indians who live scattered amongst the Cordilleras
    near Comitan, a few of whom occasionally come down to that town from
    the forests bringing for barter bags of cocoa beans.</p>

  <p>The journey from Palenque to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico had to
    be made by rivers and lagoons. The embarkation place was at Catasaja,
    where canoes were to be obtained. After riding eight leagues through
    forests and savannahs we reached “Las<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
    Playas,” where I was welcomed by
    the Licenciado Vadillo. Catasaja was a flourishing village, prettily
    situated on the upper waters of a branch of the Usamacinta. It was in
    an unusually busy state. Preparations were in progress for holding a
    fair, and celebrating the annual festival of the church. Great numbers
    of Indians and Ladinos were expected to arrive from the surrounding
    country, and sheds were being built as shelters for them. In the
    morning, at an early hour, I found that Señor Vadillo had made all
    necessary arrangements for my journey, and had secured for me a good
    canoe manned by trustworthy Indians. With his assistance I was able to
    sell my mule. The saddle and hammock were retained as I should want
    them in Yucatan.</p>

  <p>In the forenoon the men reported that the boat was ready. After
    paddling swiftly down the stream for several leagues we entered a
    channel whose muddy banks were covered with alligators. The river also
    swarmed with them. Upon several occasions I thought that the canoe was
    in danger of being capsized by the waves made by the alligators, in
    consequence, as we approached them, of their habit of slipping off the
    bank into the river, and I told the Indians to be careful. They said
    that the canoe was perfectly safe, but that if, by any accident, we
    should be rolled over there was nothing to be feared, as the alligators
    never attacked people in the water. I was doubtful about this theory,
    although it may be correct. It is well known that natives in other
    parts of the world have been seized by alligators when incautiously
    going too near them when they were watching for their prey on the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
    banks. But I do not know if there is any evidence to show that they
    would seize men in the same manner if they were actually floating in
    the water.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

  <p>Lower down the river we came to a place where the stream was sluggish.
    The banks were flat and covered with dense vegetation. Here we saw
    an extraordinary scene. The water was thick, green, and putrid with
    animal matter. The surface was covered with the inflated bodies of dead
    alligators.</p>

  <p>Large carrion birds were feeding upon them in the most revolting
    manner. Their claws were firmly fixed upon the hard skin of the
    reptiles, and they drove their beaks, like pickaxes, deep down into
    their entrails and gorged themselves with the decaying flesh. The
    stench was horrible, and together with the oppressive heat, the foul
    state of the air and the enormous mosquitoes, made this part of the
    journey very disgusting.</p>

  <p>At sunset we arrived at a place called Jonuta, near the junction of the
    river Palisada with the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
    river Usamacinta, and the canoe was hauled
    up on the bank. We could not have been far from the spot where Cortes
    crossed over on his march to Honduras, one of the most extraordinary
    military expeditions, through an absolutely unknown country and amongst
    unknown men, that has ever been successfully accomplished. This part
    of the march through the forest and across the numerous streams of
    the estuary of the Usamacinta was especially difficult and laborious,
    and at one time, the forces were driven to great straits for want of
    provisions. The events that occurred here are described by Bernal
    Diaz, who accompanied the troops, and by Cortes in his despatch to the
    Emperor Charles V. One of these events was so remarkable that it at
    once arrests the attention.</p>

  <p>The Spaniards and their Indian allies had been for several days
    suffering from famine, and the state of affairs in the camp was
    becoming serious. It was then discovered that several acts of
    cannibalism had taken place. “It appeared,” states Bernal Diaz, “that
    certain Caciques from Mexico had captured two or three of the Indians
    belonging to the villages that we had passed through, and had brought
    them hidden amongst their baggage, and on account of the hunger on
    the road they killed them and roasted them in ovens which were made
    under the ground with stones, as was their custom in Mexico, and they
    devoured them, and in the same way they had also secreted the two
    guides that we had with us who had run away, and they ate them. When
    Cortes knew what had happened he ordered the Mexican Caciques to be
    called together and spoke angrily to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
    them, and told them that if such
    things occurred again he would punish them. The Franciscan friar, who
    accompanied us, also preached to them many holy and good sayings and
    after he had concluded his sermon Cortes, as a matter of justice,
    ordered a Mexican Indian to be burnt on account of the murder of the
    Indians that they had eaten.”</p>

  <p>Cortes in reporting this punishment to the Emperor says,—“I ordered
    him to be burnt, giving the said Señor to understand the reason for
    this act of justice. That it was because he had killed an Indian and
    eaten him; which act was forbidden by your Majesty and that I, in your
    Royal name, had notified and ordered that it should not be done, and
    that therefore for having killed and eaten him I ordered him to be
    burnt.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

  <p>Another strange event that took place whilst the troops were in this
    region, was the tragic fate of Guatimozin, who had succeeded Montezuma
    as Emperor of Mexico. It is difficult to understand what could have
    been the object that Cortes had in view when he ordered this monarch
    to be executed. He may have thought it expedient to destroy, as far
    as possible, the whole race of caciques throughout New Spain and thus
    minimise the risk of any organized rebellion. These chiefs ruled with
    absolute power over the natives, and it is possible that the Spanish
    authorities deemed it advisable to get rid of them. Hundreds of them
    were burnt alive <span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
    at the stake upon the slightest pretexts. After one
    of the local insurrections the officer who suppressed it reported that
    he had burnt forty of the rebellious caciques. In a similar manner the
    leaders in Cuba and Haiti were also destroyed.</p>

  <p>In the case of Guatimozin, Cortes considered that he and his cousin,
    the King of Tlacupa, had been proved guilty of conspiring with other
    Indians to kill the Spaniards; and he accordingly ordered them to be
    put to death. The sentence was immediately carried out, and the two
    Mexican monarchs were hanged upon a tree within sight of the army as it
    continued its march through the forest.</p>

  <p>The positions where these events occurred can only be approximately
    determined. The wooden bridges which were constructed for the passage
    of the troops have disappeared. All local records of this famous march
    have passed away. The villages or pueblos mentioned by the conquerors
    no longer exist, and their names are forgotten. It is only by the most
    attentive study that even a presumptive knowledge of the route can be
    obtained. From the accounts given in the official dispatches and the
    statements of Bernal Diaz, and also from the fact that Cortes steered
    a straight course by compass, it may be concluded that the forces must
    have passed near Jonuta and about twenty-eight miles from the ruins of
    Palenque.</p>

  <p>With respect to the acts of cannibalism it should be observed, in
    justice to other tribes, that the caciques who devoured the bodies were
    Mexicans, and there are reasons for believing that before the arrival
    of the Aztecs cannibalism was unknown in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
    Central America. The method
    of cooking by baking in ovens which, after the holes had been dug out
    of the ground, were surrounded and covered by heated stones, are the
    same as those that were customary with the Maoris in New Zealand, who,
    after their fights, feasted upon their captured enemies in that manner.</p>

  <p>Upon the evening of the day upon which we left Jonuta, we reached
    Palisada and brought to an end our wearisome canoe voyage down the
    Usamacinta. At Palisada the logwood, which is obtained in the forests
    bordering upon the upper parts of the rivers, is gathered together and
    shipped upon small schooners which carry their cargoes of palo tinto
    (red wood) to the town of Laguna on the island of Carmen, whence the
    wood is sent to Europe and other parts of the world.</p>

  <p>In one of these little fore-and-aft rigged schooners I embarked and
    proceeded on my way down the river. In the afternoon we stopped in a
    place where we could get some shade until sunset. I found a shelter
    within a hut near the bank. Throughout the night the atmosphere was
    very oppressive. We slowly made our way by the help of a small boat,
    manned by our Indian crew, which took us in tow. All of us suffered
    greatly from the attacks of myriads of mosquitoes. On the following day
    we arrived at an open sheet of water, called the inner lagoon, where
    it was perfectly calm and we had to endure on the open and exposed
    deck, the full strength of the tropical sun. In the evening a strong
    head wind called “el Norte” sprang up, together with heavy squalls and
    showers of rain which continued all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
    night and the whole of the
    next day. As we could not make any headway we anchored. The sun was
    very powerful and it was not possible to escape from its influence.
    The Indians appeared to be much affected by the weather and were in
    a worn and prostrate condition. I had to endure, equally with them,
    the alternate exposure to extreme heat and cold driving rain. During
    the night the wind moderated, and towards the morning we weighed our
    anchor and proceeded to the entrance of the outer lagoon and waited for
    daylight. As the sun rose, the wind suddenly shifted, and we sailed
    rapidly across the bay to the anchorage off the town, arriving there
    early in the forenoon.</p>

  <p>Thus terminated the voyage “par los rios” (by the rivers). The exposure
    to the sun by day, the attacks of mosquitoes by night, and the sickly
    condition of the banks of the rivers and lagoons, had combined to make
    that part of the journey across the continent extremely exhausting.</p>

  <p>The long narrow island of Carmen is placed like a natural breakwater,
    sheltering the bay from the open sea of the Gulf of Campeachy. The
    earliest notice of it occurs in the Reports of the Spanish expedition
    under Grijalva in 1518. Bernal Diaz, who was one of those who took
    part in it, mentions a fact that throws some light upon the religious
    customs of the Indians. He observes that the fleet after having
    visited the coasts of Yucatan arrived at this island and remained
    for several days at anchor in the bay. Many of the officers and men
    landed, he being amongst the number. After traversing the island it
    was ascertained that it was not inhabited, but some
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span> small temples
    (adoratorios) were seen. These were made of stone and mortar, and
    contained many idols made of clay and of wood, some were like figures
    of gods, others like women, and many seemed to represent serpents. At
    the present time there are no remains visible of these adoratorios.
    The fact, however, of their having been erected upon this island is
    instructive. It tends to prove that temples were placed in positions
    where there were no inhabitants, and thus, to some extent, supports the
    theory that certain holy places were set apart for religious purposes,
    and were not necessarily attached to centres of population.</p>

  <p>During the stay of Grijalva’s fleet, a greyhound, belonging to one of
    the ships, strayed on shore and was lost. The following year, upon the
    arrival of a second expedition, when the ships anchored, the dog was
    seen on the beach watching them. Bernal Diaz relates how the dog knew
    his own ship, and fawned upon the crew when they landed, showing the
    utmost happiness and affection. How the dog had obtained food and water
    through such a long period was not known.</p>

  <p>Soon after my arrival I was informed that a small schooner called the
    Rosita was about to sail for Campeachy and that her skipper would take
    a few passengers. I accordingly made arrangements with him and went on
    board. I found that the only accommodation was the open hold under the
    main hatch. Here on the top of the cargo, made smooth and level for
    the purpose, were placed mats. We embarked two ladies and some Spanish
    officials and left La Laguna at daylight. The wind was against us and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
    we had to make a long tack towards the Yucatan coast, near Champoton.
    During the night the wind became more favourable and in the forenoon
    we sighted the white walls of Campeachy. The cathedral and mediæval
    fortifications looked very picturesque from the sea as we approached
    the coast. The Rosita did not draw much water, so we were able to
    anchor within half a mile of the landing place. I was glad to find in
    the town a tolerable inn called the Paloma, and a worthy, attentive
    landlord named Ruiz. The constant exposure and the hardships endured
    latterly had seriously affected my constitution, and I felt weak and
    ill. It was a comfort to get shelter and quiet, and the shade and rest
    which was obtained by having a large room opening upon an inner court.
    Here I remained for several days suffering from very severe headaches
    and without feeling that I was, in any perceptible degree, regaining my
    strength.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the fifth day I heard a gentle tap at the door, and
    my landlady asked if she could come in. She looked at me with much
    sympathy and said, “Señor, may I speak to you?” I replied, “Certainly.”
    She then said, “Señor, you have upon you the lagoon fever, from which
    strangers seldom recover, and I have come to ask you where you keep
    your money and where your friends live, so that I may be able to carry
    out your wishes.” I said, “My kind donna, perhaps I may get better if
    I change the air. Do you know how I can get away?” The landlady looked
    pleased and said that she knew that a certain Señor Escalanta was about
    to start for a village called Tzibalché, and that perhaps he
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span> would
    share with me the expenses of a conveyance. This arrangement was made,
    and in the forenoon a covered cart, with three mules harnessed abreast,
    was drawn up at the door of the inn. I took my place upon a mattress,
    and before midday we were several leagues away breathing the pure and
    bracing air of the open country. The change acted like magic. The fever
    seemed almost immediately to leave me, but there remained a persistent
    headache.</p>

  <p>We stopped at a village to get dinner, and met an intelligent man who
    was employed as constructor of a new road that was being made on this
    part of the coast. It had happened, that in the course of his work, he
    had made several cuttings and excavations, and discovered many things
    of much antiquarian importance. He told us of a large pyramidal altar
    or Kue which was situated in the neighbourhood, and as I particularly
    wished to see it, Señor Escalanta consented to halt whilst an
    examination of it was made.</p>

  <p>We found the altar to be one of that type of structures upon the
    summit of which the Mexican priests were accustomed to perform human
    sacrifices. This Yucatecan Kue was more than fifty feet high and was
    entirely faced with large, squared, well hewn blocks of hard limestone.
    It was very steep. I estimated the angle of the slope to be about
    70°. There were two ledges, respectively one-third and two-thirds up
    the pyramid and on the top was the platform, which was in a ruinous
    condition.</p>

  <p>There were a number of small stone chambers built on the sides. The
    existence of these singular little cells had caused the people in the
    adjacent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
    hamlets to form the opinion that the Kue had been inhabited
    by dwarfs. We examined these chambers very carefully, and although it
    was not possible to come to any satisfactory conclusion with regard to
    their purpose, it was clear that they could not have been intended for
    habitation. It seemed probable that they were either places for idols
    or that they were used as vaults for burial. They were built with much
    skill, and the squaring of the masonry was perfect. The inner wall of
    these cells was formed by the stone casing of the pyramid. Several
    small idols were found here. We were chiefly interested in examining
    the method of construction followed by the Indian architects. This was
    made apparent by the fact that portions of the outer casing had been
    demolished. It appeared that the inner portion was a solid mass of
    stones and mortar which, when completed, was covered with thick slabs
    of masonry, smooth and well jointed. On the west face there were the
    remains of a large chamber, but as that part of the pyramid was in a
    ruinous condition, its dimensions could not be measured.</p>

  <p>It is strange that so little is known concerning the ancient rites and
    ceremonies performed by the priests upon these high altars. Immediately
    after the conquest these Indian customs ceased, and all the signs of
    their religion and religious usages disappeared like a dream. When
    Grijalva’s expedition reached the Bay of Campeachy, they saw a large
    Kue which must have been similar to that we were examining. Bernal
    Diaz in his history relates that they landed to get a supply of water
    for the ships near a spot where there was a village. The natives came
    down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
    to the beach in a friendly manner, and asked them if they arrived
    from the spot where the sun rose. They then proposed that they should
    go with them to their pueblo, and took them to a large building made
    of stone and mortar. Whilst the Spaniards were looking about them
    and observing the habits of the people, “Ten Indians dressed in long
    white cloaks came out of another adoratorio. Their long thick hair was
    clotted with blood and so twisted, that it could not have been combed
    or spread without cutting it off. These men were sacerdotes of the
    idols, and in New Spain they called themselves Pápas. Again I say that
    in New Spain they called themselves Pápas, and thus I shall name them
    henceforwards. These Pápas brought to us perfumes like a kind of resin
    which they call copal, and with earthen braziers filled with fire they
    commenced to incense us.” Diaz thought that the stone buildings were
    altars, and he saw numerous idols, and “it appeared to us,” he says,
    “that at this time they had been sacrificing to the idols certain
    Indians to give them the victory over us.”</p>

  <p>On their further voyage near another part of the Mexican coast, where
    is now situated the town of Vera Cruz, the fleet arrived at the Island
    of Sacrificios, a name that was given to that land in consequence of
    what was observed to take place there. The island was explored by the
    Spaniards, and they discovered two Kues made of lime and stone, and
    ascended by steps. “In these altars,” observes Diaz, “were idols of
    evil figures which were their gods, and here they had sacrificed on
    the previous night five Indians. Their breasts were opened and their
    arms and thighs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
    were cut off and the walls were covered with blood.”
    It happened that the Chaplain-General of the Fleet wrote an itinerary
    of this voyage, and he also visited these temples. He mentioned the
    extraordinary fact of having noticed within one of the shrines “some
    bordered stuff made of silk, similar to what was worn by the Moors and
    which were called by them “Almaizales.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> At another temple, situated
    near the coast, four Indian priests were seen, who had lately been
    performing sacrifices. In this instance they had sacrificed two young
    boys. Their breasts had been opened and their hearts had been taken out
    and placed before the idol as an offering. The Spaniards were surprised
    when they observed that these priests were dressed like Dominicans and
    wore long cloaks and capes. This, together with their manner of using
    incense, seemed in some inexplicable degree to resemble the observances
    of their own monastic fraternities.</p>

  <p>In the various accounts that have been given by the conquerors
    concerning the Indians, there is nothing mentioned about the burial
    customs, and even at the present time the subject is obscure. I was
    therefore interested in listening to the contractor’s remarks about
    some discoveries made by his workmen when excavating along the line of
    road. They found the ruins of several houses. Each of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>them contained
    beneath the centre of the principal room a vaulted tomb, in which it
    was supposed that the proprietor had been buried when he died. They
    also found, when tracing the direction of the work, several small Kues
    of pyramidal shapes, around the sides of which were numerous small
    stone cells. The contractor told me that he had measured and surveyed
    these carefully. He had come to the conclusion that they were burial
    places.</p>

  <p>These discoveries were important, and corroborated in every essential
    particular the statements of several Indian caciques dwelling beyond
    Uxmal, in the sixteenth century. They informed the Spanish missionaries
    that it had been customary, with the common people in Yucatan, to
    bury their dead either inside their houses or at the back of them.
    In certain cases they afterwards abandoned these dwellings and moved
    elsewhere. The bodies of caciques and chiefs were burnt, and the ashes
    were placed in urns. Small pyramids or temples were sometimes raised
    over them.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

  <p>I was sorry when it became necessary to proceed on our journey. The
    road contractor was an official who took a comprehensive interest
    in whatever related to the ancient inhabitants, and his practical
    knowledge was invaluable.</p>

  <p>It was late when we finished the survey of the pyramid and its
    chambers; we consequently travelled <span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
    throughout the night at our best
    speed. We passed through the pueblos of Tenabon and Hekelchakan and
    reached Señor Escalanta’s house in Tzibalché at daylight. We were
    received by the ladies of the establishment with cold and tranquil
    apathy. Without saying a word, they turned out of their hammocks, and
    proceeded to carry out their respective household duties. It must be
    understood that the arrangements with all Ladino families are very
    simple. In the <span xml:lang="es">tierras calientes</span> or hot regions every one sleeps in a
    hammock. The hammocks are slung to the cross poles in the principal,
    and often, only apartment. At night when the ladies wish to go to bed
    they turn in, to use a sailor’s expression, all standing. The women
    of all ages, young or old, wear but one dress which is always a long
    cotton garment reaching from the shoulders to the feet. This is worn
    day and night. The languid indifference of men and women, towards
    each other and to all around them, is a marked characteristic of the
    whole of the Ladino race throughout Central America. Nothing seems to
    arouse their indolent natures, and although many of them are fairly
    educated, they do not appear to have those qualities which form the
    foundation of a good and energetic population. It cannot be considered
    that the enervating influences of a tropical climate are chiefly the
    cause of this inertness, for it exists in varying altitudes. It should,
    however, be acknowledged that this half-caste race retains much of the
    old-fashioned courtesy of their Spanish ancestors. The Ladinos have
    ceased to intermarry with the Indians, and there is now no sympathy
    between the two races.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
    The Indians have almost as great a dislike to
    them as they have to the Spaniards.</p>

  <p>At Tzibalché I enlisted in my service an Indian, named Anastasio, and
    after some difficulty, hired a horse of doubtful merit. Anastasio
    declared that we could avoid the long round to Uxmal by the main roads,
    as he knew a short cut across the country which would shorten the
    journey. By that path, he said, the distance to the hacienda at Uxmal
    did not exceed nine or ten leagues. Accordingly we quitted the village
    at sunrise and soon afterwards entered the bush.</p>

  <p>This part of Yucatan was covered with a thin light kind of brushwood
    which grew to a height of about twelve feet. Our path was cut through
    this bush which excluded all view to the right or left. Occasionally
    we passed through a few acres of open land where the Indians were
    cultivating some crops, but the soil was poor and stony. At noon we
    arrived at a farm; the proprietor was inclined to be hospitable and
    gave me food and shelter. I was suffering from a recurrence of what I
    had endured at Campeachy and could scarcely bear the fatigue of the
    journey, especially as the rays of the nearly vertical sun were very
    powerful.</p>

  <p>During the afternoon, whilst resting in the shade, I listened to the
    loud, discordant, and grating sounds pronounced by the Indians around
    me. The language spoken was Maya, which has been ascertained to be the
    parent stock of most of the languages and dialects spoken in Guatemala,
    Yucatan and the bordering territories. I asked my host to give me a
    specimen of their dialect. He replied that he would tell me
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span> what had
    happened in the morning, and he leant forward and said:—<span xml:lang="myn">“Ti lé kin
    béhilá, kuch yuayé humpel tzul ingles, bin tiar ten. Tumentin, katah
    uchi y etel tin káhol ta hatchutz apockzi chalé; katin kámá tin nayle,
    katin sah balu hante kati álá téné bin ku bétic Uxmal, tacthoh cásumac
    tuh lú mil.”</span> “This day came here an English Señor and spoke to me.
    Having questioned him and knowing him to be of a good heart, I received
    him in my house and gave him to eat. Then he told me that he was going
    to Uxmal, and thence to Merida and afterwards to his own land.”</p>

  <p>Towards the end of the day, when the sun was low, I ventured out of
    the hut, mounted my horse, and pushed forward rapidly towards Uxmal.
    After passing through several plantations of sugar-cane attached to
    small Indian farms, we reached some rising ground and I saw, about four
    miles distant towards the east, the great building, called the Casa
    del Gobernador, with its terraces and adjacent pyramids standing out
    high and distinct. The sun had disappeared below the horizon, and the
    sky was brilliant with the vivid colouring of a tropical sunset. The
    Casa del Gobernador was clear and well defined in the midst of this
    magnificent frame of evening splendour, looking scarcely less beautiful
    than a Greek temple on some lofty headland, when seen at twilight from
    Ægean seas.</p>

  <p>It was getting dark when we slowly passed round the base of a Teocalli,
    and it was night when we halted at the hacienda. The proprietor and
    the agent were both absent, but the mayor-domo received me with much
    kindness. He gave me a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
    room next to one which he told me had
    been occupied by the Empress Charlotte when she visited Uxmal in 1866.
    The next morning, after giving Anastasio directions to join me at the
    Casa del Gobernador and to bring with him my hammock and provisions, I
    walked out to the ruins.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is considered that the ruins of Uxmal are, in extent and
    construction, the most important in Yucatan, and therefore, excepting
    in certain particulars, those at Palenque, the most remarkable in
    Central America and Mexico.</p>

  <p>The ground occupied by them is in length about six hundred yards.
    The width is slightly more than five hundred yards. Consequently the
    area within which Uxmal is contained, may be approximately estimated
    as being sixty acres. It therefore exceeds by twenty acres the space
    covered by the mounds of Palenque. The buildings are irregularly
    placed. The Casa del Gobernador (House of the Governor) with its
    adjacent pyramids form the principal group towards the south. The
    Casa de las Monjas (House of the Nuns) is situated towards the north.
    These are the two great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
    structures upon which the other temples and
    mounds seem chiefly to depend. There are two smaller edifices called
    respectively, the Casa de las Palomas (House of the Pigeons) and the
    Casa de las Tortugas (House of the Turtles). There is also a detached
    pyramid with a ruined temple upon its summit, which has been given the
    name of the House of the Old Woman. Looking at these ruins as a group,
    they appear to have consisted of quadrangular residences with pyramidal
    mounds attached to them, raised for the purpose of obtaining lofty
    sites for the altars of the Indian gods.</p>

  <p>One of the most important of these is that known as the Pyramid of
    the Dwarf. I examined it with particular attention for the purpose
    of studying the character of a series of small stone vaults or cells
    placed round its base, which were similar in size and design to those
    that I had seen on the lower slopes of the Kue near the coast above
    Campeachy. Many of these cells were sufficiently perfect to enable
    their dimensions and shape to be verified. It seemed evident that they
    must have been made for sepulchral purposes. If this conclusion is
    correct it is probable that they were the burial places for the ashes
    of the caciques who ruled over this part of Yucatan.</p>

  <p>Upon an investigation of the outer parts of the pyramid, it is to be
    observed that it was not only carefully constructed, but its plan must
    have been accurately drawn and the relative mathematical measurements
    calculated with reference to the space that was required for the
    temple. The magnitude of the base could not be determined, on account
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
    the quantities of fallen stones and other débris. In 1841, Mr.
    Stephens considered that it was two hundred and thirty-five feet long
    by one hundred and fifty-five feet wide. The perpendicular height to
    the platform was estimated to be eighty-eight feet.</p>

   <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_340f"><img src="images/i_340f.jpg" width="507" height="700" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption smcap">Pyramid and Temple of the Dwarf.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The steps leading up to the summit are broad, and must have formed an
    imposing approach, but in consequence of the angle of the slope they
    are necessarily steep, and are placed so close together that there
    is barely sufficient width for the foot to rest. At the base of the
    pyramid there is an open court, which I observed to be similar in shape
    to one adjoining the base of an altar built by the Quichés at Utatlan,
    but it was larger in extent. The court leads to the entrance of the
    Casa de las Monjas.</p>

  <p>This building may be considered to be the result of the greatest powers
    of sculpture and ornamentation that the Indians possessed, and judging
    from the condition of many of its chambers, it is probably one of the
    latest of their works. It is nearly quadrangular, and encloses an area
    of over six thousand square yards.</p>

  <p>My first day at Uxmal was employed in making a rough survey of the land
    occupied by the ruins.</p>

  <p>Upon my return to the hacienda, I found that an evening service, called
    “el Rosario,” was being held in the chapel. A large number of Indians
    were assembled. These Yucatecos had attached to the fingers of the
    church images, many of their own small idols, made of metal. It was
    consequently impossible to know (as the priests in the Cordilleras
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
    said of their Indian parishioners), whether they were worshipping the
    saints, or following in secret their ancient idolatries.</p>

  <p>The next morning I established myself in the “House of the Governor,”
    and selected for our occupation the largest of the outer series of
    apartments, opening upon the eastern courts. The size of these was
    necessarily regulated by the angle of the converging slopes of the
    walls, for the builders were limited in their plans in consequence
    of their incomplete acquaintance with the formation of arches. In
    one of the rooms there were some cross poles made of zapote wood, to
    which Anastasio fastened my hammock. The architectural proportions
    of the exterior are unusual. The length is about three hundred and
    twenty-two feet, but the breadth is only thirty-nine feet, and the
    low, narrow structure, is only twenty-five feet high. The effect,
    however, of the long and elaborately carved façade, is particularly
    pleasing both to the eye and the mind. In all respects, the Casa del
    Gobernador is rightly given the distinction of being the grandest of
    the stone structures that were built by Indians. The platform upon
    which this great edifice stands, is forty feet above the level of the
    ground. Sixteen feet below this is a large open court, which is about
    one hundred and eighty yards long, and over eighty-two yards wide,
    containing a level surface of nearly fifteen thousand square yards—or
    more than three acres. There is a third outer terrace, raised a few
    feet above the plain.</p>

  <p>The Casa de las Monjas is also placed upon three terraces, but they are
    of smaller dimensions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
    the height of the base of the building
    above the natural ground, is not more than seventeen feet. The terraces
    were surrounded by strongly built walls. Wide stone steps gave access
    to each platform. When looking at these flat spaces, pyramids and
    temples, it is practicable to form reasonable conjectures regarding the
    nature of the religious ceremonies that may have taken place within, or
    before them.</p>

  <p>Bishop Landa, in his work on Yucatan, which he wrote in that country
    soon after the conquest, gives an account of the feasts and sacrifices
    performed in the temples. His description was based upon information
    which he received from the descendants of caciques, who had governed a
    powerful tribe dwelling east of Uxmal. After mentioning the nature of
    the offerings made to the idols during certain festivals, he observes
    that, besides sacrificing animals, the priests would sometimes on
    occasions of tribulation or public necessity, command that human
    victims should be sacrificed. There is this statement given of what
    then happened.</p>

  <p>“Every one took their part in offering contributions, in order that
    slaves should be bought, and some of the more devotional would offer
    their little children. Great care was taken of them that they should
    not run away or commit any fault, and whilst they were conducted from
    village to village with dancing, the priests fasted. Upon the arrival
    of the day, they all came into the patio (court) of the temple, and if
    the victim had to be sacrificed by wounds from arrows he was stripped
    naked, his body was anointed with blue, and a cap like a mitre was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
    placed on his head.” He was then, after certain dances made by the
    people in honour of the god, killed by flights of arrows.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that a similar custom was followed by the
    Pawnees in North America who, upon certain occasions, chiefly in
    connection with offering a propitiation to the Manito who had power
    over the harvest, also killed the victim by a flight of arrows.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The
    coincidence of this practice is very strange.</p>

  <p>Landa, after relating the manner in which these Indians in Yucatan
    conducted the ceremony of inflicting death by arrows, proceeds to
    state what was done if the priests, for some special reasons, directed
    that the victim should be offered to the gods in accordance with their
    more appalling rites. “If it had been decided to take out the heart,
    he was taken to the patio with much pomp, and was accompanied by many
    people, and after being daubed over with blue, and his mitre placed on
    his head, he was carried to the round step which was the place where
    these sacrifices were made, and after the priest (sacerdote) and his
    officials had anointed this stone with blue colour, and had cast out
    the devil by purifying the temple; the unfortunate man that was to be
    sacrificed was then seized, thrown suddenly backwards upon the stone,
    and held there by the legs and arms kept apart from the middle. Then
    came the sacrificer with a stone razor, and struck with much dexterity
    and cruelty, a gash between the ribs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
    of the left side below the
    teat; he then thrust in his hand and took hold of the heart like a
    furious tiger and snatched it out still palpitating, and put it upon a
    dish which he gave to the priest, who took it quickly and anointed the
    faces of the idols with the fresh blood.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

    <div class="caption smcap">An Angle of the Casa de las Monjas.</div>
  </div>

  <p>This statement of the sacrificial customs in Yucatan is in accordance
    with the Report made by Palacio<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> concerning the sacrifices of the
    captives taken in war by the Pipiles, a tribe who were believed to be
    of Mexican origin and were then dwelling near the Pacific coast of
    Guatemala. It may also be surmised that the ceremonies performed by the
    priests of the Quichés upon the altars at Utatlan were of a similar
    nature. It thus seems evident that the barbarous practices that are
    supposed to have been introduced by the Aztecs into Mexico, during some
    period subsequent to the twelfth century, were becoming prevalent in
    Central America.</p>

  <p>It is possible that the custom of offering human sacrifices, together
    with subsequent acts of cannibalism, may have become grafted upon
    the religious observances of an earlier and less cruel race. It is,
    however, to be noticed that the plan of the pyramid of the Dwarf with
    its altar, and the open court at the foot of the steps leading down
    from the temple, conform with the particular purposes of the ceremonies
    connected with the sacrifices to the idols. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
    Bernal Diaz, when
    describing the manner in which the Spanish captives were sacrificed and
    eaten during the siege of Mexico, mentions facts which agree with the
    statements made by the caciques in Yucatan, concerning the events that
    occasionally happened in their sacred places.</p>

  <p>“Sometimes,” observes Landa, “the sacrifice took place on the stone
    upon the highest step of the temple, and then the body was thrown down
    the steps and rolled below. The officials then seized it and flayed off
    the skin excepting the feet and hands, and the priest, having taken off
    his garments until he was naked, covered himself with it, and danced
    with the others. This was considered to be a matter of much solemnity.
    It was the custom to bury those who were sacrificed in the court of the
    temple, or, if not, they were eaten by the chiefs and those who were
    able to obtain portions; the hands, feet and head were for the priest
    and officials. Those who were thus sacrificed were held as saints
    (tenian por santos). If they were slaves captured in war their owner
    took the bones and kept them to show them in the dances as emblems of
    victory.”</p>

  <p>The aboriginal inhabitants of Yucatan were, like those dwelling in the
    neighbouring land of Guatemala, devoted to the worship of idols, and
    travelled great distances to take part in the ceremonies which were
    performed at the shrines of their principal gods. The Island of Cozumel
    was one of the sacred sites which was held in great veneration when
    the fleet of Grijalva arrived there in 1518. It was observed by the
    Spaniards that there and elsewhere, the pyramidal structures or altars
    were maintained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
    in good order, and had regular priests attached to
    them for the purpose of executing the various duties connected with the
    superstitious usages. It was afterwards ascertained that several of the
    larger sacred temples in the interior had at that time been abandoned,
    although many of them looked as if they had not been long built. With
    respect to Uxmal, it was considered that the ruins were comparatively
    modern and belonged to a period but little anterior to the Spanish
    conquest.</p>

  <p>The well preserved state of portions of the buildings is, at the
    present time, nearly four centuries after the arrival of the
    Spaniards, especially noticeable. I observed that the wooden lintel
    over the door of my room in the Casa del Gobernador was in perfect
    condition. The edges or corners were still sharp and unworn. It was
    also evident that, although the great weight of the masonry above must
    have exerted a heavy pressure upon the centre of the lintel, there
    were no signs of the slightest deflection. The strength of the wood
    seemed to be unimpaired. The preservation of many of the lintels over
    the doorways of the rooms in the Casa de las Monjas was, in several
    instances, equally sound. Many of the stone carvings on the exterior
    were also apparently uninjured by their exposure to the weather. But,
    before proceeding with this subject, it is expedient to take into
    consideration some of the characteristics of this building.</p>

  <p>It is not known why it was called the Casa de las Monjas (House of the
    Nuns). Possibly the Spaniards may have been surprised by its similarity
    in plan with their own nunneries, but it is also not improbable
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span> that
    there may have been some tradition received from the Indians which
    caused the adoption of this name. It has been stated by Clavigero, and
    other historians, that there were certain especial customs attending
    the worship of the god Quetzalcoatl. Women served for terms of years
    within his temples. They were dedicated to the performance of religious
    service from an early age, lodged in a convent and instructed in
    religion. They were also educated and employed in a manner suitable
    to their station and sex. It was said that certain vows were made and
    various religious duties were performed.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_348"><img src="images/i_348.jpg" width="600" height="483" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption">Entrance to the Casa de las Monjas.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

  <p>The main entrance to the nunnery is through a gateway placed in the
    centre of the southern part of the quadrangle. Upon each side of this
    entrance there are four chambers, and it is to be noticed, as an
    evidence of the conventual character of the building, that these are
    the only rooms that have direct access to the outer world. All the
    others are within and look into the court. They had a blank wall at the
    back, which excluded all communication with the exterior. The principal
    front looks towards the pyramids adjoining the Casa del Gobernador.
    The architectural proportions of the archway are symmetrical. The
    height and span, like all other parts of these Indian structures, are
    practically determined by the angle of inclination of the converging
    sides. In this case the arch is about seventeen feet high and nearly
    eleven feet wide. After passing through it, a wide court is entered. It
    is surrounded on four sides by long ranges of low stone buildings. The
    base, or lower part of them, is built of plain square slabs of masonry.
    The upper parts are covered with fanciful designs, sculptured with
    great skill.</p>

  <p>The whole of these buildings are exclusively arranged for the purpose
    of providing the greatest possible number of chambers or monastic
    cells. I did not count them, but it has been stated that there are
    altogether eighty-eight. It is perhaps important to note, with
    reference to this unusual number of rooms, that they are too numerous
    to admit of the theory that they were intended for the accommodation
    of the priests serving the adjacent temples, for according to the
    statements of Clavigero, the number of priests always corresponded with
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
    number of the Teocallis. It is therefore presumable that these
    cells had some other purpose. The priests may have been lodged in the
    Casa del Gobernador. That building contains twenty-four chambers, the
    majority of which are of the same size and plan as these in the Casa de
    las Monjas. It is useless to attempt to conjecture the precise purposes
    of these buildings, for there has been no exact information obtained
    upon the subject, but everything points to the conclusion that the
    whole of the structures at Uxmal were connected with the worship of the
    gods, and had no relation to the ordinary lives of the Indians.</p>

  <p>It is probable that places like Uxmal and Palenque with their temples
    and monasteries, were set apart for religious purposes, and the
    Indians assembled there from the adjacent country with the object of
    being present at the ceremonies, in the same manner as they are now
    accustomed to perform their pilgrimages when the patron saints of the
    churches have their festivals. When taking into consideration the
    question of the period when it may be conjectured that the temples at
    Uxmal were abandoned, it is necessary to direct attention to the design
    or emblem which is placed upon one of the walls of the interior of the
    Casa de las Monjas.</p>

  <p>Upon an examination of the accompanying illustration, it will be
    observed that the figure represented is that of a huge serpent or
    rattlesnake. A serpent was also the emblem or Totem of one of the
    tribes of the Mound Builders in Ohio, and there appear to be singular
    resemblances between the reptile carved in stone at Uxmal and that
    which is rudely made of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
    earth and stones, and placed on high ground
    overlooking a valley in North America. Both reptiles have peculiarly
    large mouths, opened wide, ready to devour and swallow their prey
    or their enemies. It is perhaps not unreasonable to infer that the
    tribe who migrated from the north, conquered the unwarlike natives
    of Yucatan, raised the great pyramids, and built the temples in that
    region, were subsequently conquered by a more powerful tribe of the
    same race, also migrating from higher latitudes. The former tribe were
    forced to desert their buildings, and avoided slavery or extermination
    by escaping into the interior. The serpent stands out in bold relief.
    The whole of the façades of the nunnery are elaborately sculptured, and
    the mechanical abilities of the builders are well brought into notice.</p>

  </div>

  <p>As all investigations or theories respecting these architects and their
    works, depend greatly upon the conclusions that may be drawn from the
    evidence regarding the period when Uxmal was built, I directed my
    attention to certain points bearing upon this subject. Conjectures
    upon the origin and civilisation of the Indians must be influenced by
    what can be ascertained with respect to the probable dates when these
    religious buildings were constructed.</p>

  <p>It is to be seen in the Casa de las Monjas that there was a lavish use
    of ornamentation in stone. There is, throughout, a wealth of sculpture
    which is astonishing when it is remembered that the sculptors, as far
    as we know, had no proper implements to work with. Stone chisels and
    obsidian scrapers appear to be inadequate for the purpose.</p>

  <p>It can be understood that if the Indian masons
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span> and stone cutters had
    wished to show their ability, they might have adorned their buildings
    with barbarous figures or rude idols, such as were carved by the
    natives of Easter Island out of soft volcanic stone. But at Uxmal they
    revelled in their powers. The walls of the Nunnery and the Casa del
    Gobernador are covered with designs deeply cut and perfectly joined.
    Thus it is proved that the sculptors had not only much capacity as
    workmen, but they must have been able to chisel hard limestone with
    ease and facility of execution. In the interior of the Nunnery many
    of the designs are most artistic. Nothing can be more graceful than
    the block of buildings on the eastern side of the quadrangle. The
    lattice work, in its appearance and general effect, seems to have an
    indefinable accordance with the wood and stone carvings that are to
    be seen in the ancient quarters of Cairo, and the interior of the
    earliest Arabian mosques. Upon the opposite side of the quadrangle,
    the ornamentation upon the walls is of a different character and in
    some respects resembles the designs of Hindoo or Buddhist architecture.
    This confusion of styles is puzzling to the eye and embarrassing to the
    judgment.</p>

  <p>At Palenque the long corridors, the courts, and the use of coloured
    stucco ornamentation appeared to have some vague relation to a mixed
    style of Moorish and Spanish architecture. If a corsair, with a crew
    of Moors and a cargo of Spanish captives, had been driven by the trade
    wind across the Atlantic, and the strangers, after landing upon the
    new continent, had married the daughters of the caciques; it would be
    intelligible that the descendants of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>mixed races might have
    constructed monasteries, temples and pyramids of this strange and
    complex design. Such was my impression when pacing the corridors at
    Palenque.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_352f"><img src="images/i_352f.jpg" width="700" height="436" alt="" /></a>
    <div class="caption smcap">Interior of the Casa de las Monjas and its adjoining Pyramid and Temple, Uxmal.</div>
  </div>

  <p>At Uxmal there were no coloured stuccoes and no corridors. The bold and
    fantastic style of the sculptures had a character more Eastern, and it
    might be permissible to imagine that wandering fakirs from Hindostan,
    or Buddhist pilgrims from Java, Burmah or Cambodia, had reached the
    Pacific coasts, and had implanted their incomplete acquaintance with
    the forms of Hindoo or Buddhist temples upon the barbaric ideas of the
    Indians, and that in this manner were produced the fanciful types of
    construction or symbolism that are present at Uxmal.</p>

  <p>These are only conjectures, but it cannot be supposed that this
    knowledge of architecture and of sculpture arose as suddenly as it
    disappeared, and sprang into existence as the outcome of the natural
    capacity of the Indian mind. The problem is interesting and attractive.
    It is one that is exceedingly difficult to solve.</p>

  <p>There are certain differences in the methods of construction of
    Palenque and Uxmal which have to be analyzed. The walls at Palenque
    are composed of compact masses of stones and mortar covered with thick
    layers of cement. At Uxmal no coatings of cement are used and the walls
    are faced with well-worked masonry. At Palenque there are great numbers
    of human figures either formed of thick stucco, or graven upon slabs
    of stone. At Uxmal there are no human figures, no delineations of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
    caciques, priests, or captive victims. The principle of ornamentation
    is different.</p>

  <p>Judging from the condition and appearance of the buildings it is clear
    that Uxmal must be more modern than Palenque, and this is particularly
    noticeable upon an examination of the Casa del Gobernador and the
    Casa de las Monjas. The influences of the tropical climate (Uxmal is
    half a degree south of the twenty-first parallel) are such as would
    be expected to act injuriously upon exposed limestone sculptures, for
    between May and November the rains are heavy and continuous. But the
    façades of these structures seem to have been very little affected by
    the weather.</p>

  <p>In forming opinions respecting the antiquity of ruins, it is perhaps
    injudicious to give much weight to considerations based upon appearance
    or state of dilapidation, but in the instance of Uxmal there are
    circumstances which make it impossible to admit that it belongs to
    a period more than very few centuries earlier than the arrival of
    the Spaniards. Thus the preservation of the wooden lintels over the
    doorways in the Casa de las Monjas must be taken into consideration,
    when any attempts are made to estimate the age of that building. They
    have had to bear considerable pressure, for there are heavy masses of
    concrete and masonry to be supported.</p>

  <p>With regard to this subject, it is necessary to draw attention to the
    size and construction of one of the principal rooms which I measured,
    and it will be understood how the architects were limited or restricted
    in their actions, and to what extent the employment of wood was found
    to be requisite.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span></p>

  <p>It was a narrow chamber twenty feet four inches long, twelve feet
    wide, and about twenty-three feet high. The height of the entrance was
    eight feet, the width six feet seven inches. The interior walls were
    perpendicular up to nine feet three inches from the ground, and then
    curved inwards until they approached within one foot of each other.
    They were capped by broad flat stone slabs. The curvature of the walls
    was correctly formed, and a considerable gain in space was thereby
    obtained. It was evident that the Indians were advancing towards a
    knowledge of the round arch and keystone. This form of rounding the
    inner roof was not however adopted in all the rooms of the nunnery.
    Many of them still retained the straight lines of converging walls, as
    at Palenque. The manner in which the advance in construction had been
    reached was simple and yet ingenious.</p>

  <p>I measured a room in another part of the quadrangle which had different
    dimensions, and was more in accordance with the earlier system of
    building. It was twenty-two feet long and ten feet five inches wide.
    The height of the perpendicular portion of the walls was eight feet
    three inches, and the length of the upper slope to the cap-stone was
    eight feet nine inches. The total height of the room about sixteen
    feet. The doorway was a little over seven feet high and the width
    was five feet eight inches. The dimensions of the chambers round the
    quadrangle varied, but the instances I have given represent their
    average sizes. There were two lintels over each doorway, for the width
    of each piece of timber was not sufficient to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span> occupy the full depth of
    the wall. In the first-mentioned chamber they were each nine feet five
    inches long, one foot wide and eight inches deep, and had a bearing
    upon each wall of one foot five inches. In this and other openings the
    inner lintel rested in its place a little lower than the outer one.
    The object of this singular method of placing these supports was not
    apparent. The lintels were externally in perfect condition, and were
    without any signs of decay.</p>

  <p>The main mass of the Uxmal walls is composed of rubble limestones, made
    into a strong compact substance, by the plentiful use of good binding
    mortar. Each facing stone was made into a triangular shape, and the
    point or apex seems to have been pushed or fitted into its place, and
    there firmly secured by mortar. This method of applying the masonry
    was adopted not only with the plain smooth blocks of square stone used
    for facing the lower portions of the buildings, but also with all the
    sculptured portions of the walls. The blocks fit closely together
    in their places so accurately and with such careful finish that the
    joints or edges can scarcely be distinguished. It is thus made evident
    that the stone-masons who built Uxmal must have been men capable of
    performing their work with skill. The architect must have possessed a
    competent knowledge of the preparation of a plan or design, and the
    masons, in separately executing their part of the sculpture, must
    have been able to follow the design with an exactness that is almost
    mathematical.</p>

  <p>There have been many theories respecting the methods that may have been
    practised by the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
    Indians in executing their carvings upon stone,
    but no knowledge has been obtained which throws sufficient light upon
    the subject.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> No attention has however been directed to the artisan
    qualities of the workmen who shaped and fitted the lintels, which
    however prove that the workers in wood were as skilful as the masons.
    The lintels were made of wood harder than mahogany. I examined many
    of them with the utmost care, and could not detect the slightest mark
    or dent. It is doubtful whether a good carpenters plane could have
    given them a smoother surface. The zapote trees out of which
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>they
    were formed, must have been fashioned into broad baulks of timber, and
    afterwards squared and divided into the required lengths. The face of
    the timber was levelled and smoothed, and the corners or angles were
    sharply defined. All this work had to be done, as far as is known, with
    stone implements.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Quadrangle, Casa de las Monjas.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Upon taking a final glance at these ruins it seems reasonable to form
    the conclusion that Uxmal was built exclusively for the purposes of
    religion. The pyramids and their teocallis or temples were devoted as
    shrines for the gods, and monasteries were attached to them. The human
    sacrifices and the ceremonies that were customary in time of war took
    place in the open courts attached to the high altars of the chief idols.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <blockquote>
    <p>Upon the last day of my stay at Uxmal, the morning was fine
      and the sky was clear. In the forenoon I observed that there
      were dense volumes of light-coloured smoke covering the fields
      towards the east. As the day advanced the air became hot and
      oppressive, and the sky was obscured. Upon inquiring the cause
      of this smoke I was told that the Indians were burning their
      weeds and stalks in accordance with their custom at that time
      of the year.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon, whilst I was engaged in sketching the
      south-east angle of the Casa del Gobernador, heavy drops of
      rain began suddenly to fall. As it was the dry season, this
      change of weather was unexpected. The rain drops soon ceased,
      but after an interval there were some slight showers which
      continued for about two hours. At the farmhouse I was told
      that such weather was unusual, and that the rain must have
      been caused by the smoke and heat rising from the fires. If
      this opinion was correct the change may have been caused by
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
      the heated air rising into a cooler region above, and thus
      producing an atmospherical disturbance.</p>

    <p>This fact of rain being produced or caused by human agency
      supports the opinion that the efforts of the rain-makers
      amongst the North American Indians were in accordance with some
      vague knowledge, and were not altogether absurd, and that the
      action of the Californian rain-maker, whose attempts to obtain
      rain were successful, was based upon an experience which was
      practical.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> sunrise on the day of our departure from Uxmal, the Indians were
    hurrying along the paths on their way to the corn fields, and the women
    were engaged in carrying water from the wells. It was a busy scene of
    life and movement.</p>

  <p>We proceeded to Múna and then journeyed onwards to the village of Abalá
    which we reached in the afternoon, having accomplished a distance of
    eight leagues. We obtained shelter in a public building called the
    cabildo, which was used as a travellers’ rest house, where everyone,
    as in a Turkish or Syrian caravansary, selected whatever spot was
    available or unoccupied. Anastasio deposited the luggage in a corner
    and found a place where my hammock could be secured above the ground.</p>

  <p>Upon examining my horse I found that it was quite unfit for work, and
    therefore I went at once to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
    the head man of the district, who was an
    Indian holding the office of Judge, and was at the time sitting in the
    Court-house. I asked him if he would give directions that I should be
    supplied with another horse or mule to carry me to Merida. The Judge at
    first made some objections and said that there were no horses, or that,
    if there were any, they were in the fields and would have to be caught.
    Finally, after a long discussion, the second or junior Judge, who
    seemed inclined to help me, promised that a horse should be ready at
    the cabildo on the following day as soon as the sun appeared. Trusting
    in this arrangement, I discharged Anastasio and sent him back with the
    old horse to Tzibalché.</p>

  <p>In the morning the sun duly appeared but no horse came, and as
    Anastasio had left at daybreak, I found myself unattended, and
    surrounded by strange groups of Indians passing through Abalá. It
    was fortunate that, in accordance with a local regulation, an Indian
    alguazil was in charge of the cabildo, for this native official
    immediately informed me that he would attend to my requirements. He
    was useful in carrying out my wishes, and performed his duties with
    care and zeal. After waiting for an hour to see if any horse arrived,
    I went again to the Court-house but found that the Judges were not
    sitting, and that they were away for the day upon other occupations. On
    my return to my quarters it was evident that some event had occurred.
    I was told that a band of muleteers on their way from the interior had
    halted there, and intended to proceed to Merida later in the day, after
    their mules had been given rest and food. These men were
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> uncouth and
    noisy, but I thought it would be wise to join them, if they made no
    objection. It happened that they had with them a young horse that was
    not laden. After overcoming some preliminary difficulties, an agreement
    was made that I should hire the horse, but that he was not to carry
    any weight except that of the rider; one of their mules was to convey
    my luggage. As soon as all preparations were completed the leader of
    the muleteers told me that they would be ready to proceed late in the
    afternoon and that he would call for me at the cabildo. The men then
    dispersed.</p>

  <p>Having the greater part of the day at my disposal, I walked out beyond
    the village for the purpose of being present at an Indian ceremony. It
    was the commemoration of a death that had taken place in the previous
    year. I was informed that in this part of Yucatan it was the custom
    amongst the Indians to have three services or meetings of this nature.
    The first took place a week after the death; the second after an
    interval of a month, and the last on the anniversary. This was the
    anniversary service and was considered the most important. Very few
    of the religious ceremonies of the Indians have been permitted to be
    maintained, for they were so singularly connected with their worship of
    demons, that it was found necessary to abolish everything that recalled
    their ancient superstitions. These memorial observances are, however,
    to a modified extent yet performed.</p>

  <p>Upon arriving at the hut I saw that it was crowded with Indians. I
    was received in the usual manner with apparent inattention, and was
    allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
    to take my place with the others. I noticed that my friend
    the junior Judge, who had promised to send me a horse, was one of the
    mourners. As he made no remark and I had made other plans the subject
    was not mentioned, and my attention was directed to what was going
    on around me. The Indians were engaged in making melancholy sounds
    of wailing. In the centre of the room was a table upon which was a
    large plain wooden cross. Before the cross were placed offerings of
    flowers, fruits and baked tortillas. I waited for some time to see what
    ceremonies were going to take place, but nothing happened. The wailing
    continued in a dreary and monotonous manner.</p>

  <p>The scene reminded me in some respects of observances of a religious
    character that I had previously witnessed when travelling amongst the
    Cordilleras of Guatemala, and again at a village near Tzibalché, on
    the road to Uxmal. When the Spanish priests settled in their various
    parishes in these regions after the conquest, it was noticed by them
    that the Indians appeared to have a peculiar dread of death. This dread
    did not seem to be caused by any personal fear, but had its origin in
    connection with their belief in demons. They believed that death was
    an evil spirit that required to be propitiated, and whose influence
    over the sick or dying person was malignant. Thus it was usual to make
    offerings to this demon, who was supposed to be lying in wait somewhere
    near the hut. They imagined that he might be contented with what was
    given to him and not carry off his victim. When I was at Palenque,
    I was told that in some of the remote parts of the province, this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
    ancient observance still existed and that the Indians placed offerings
    of food outside the door of the hut in the hope that the demon would be
    appeased, and pass by without stopping to enter within.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In Yucatan
    a similar custom prevailed, but the method of propitiation was slightly
    different. Various kinds of food and jars of liquid were hung upon the
    walls or thatch outside the hut to gratify the demon and cause him to
    accept the offerings instead of human life.</p>

  <p>Amongst the ancient customs of the Indians none, however, are more
    strange than those connected with an almost unintelligible form of
    baptism. The Franciscan missionaries who endeavoured to convert the
    Indians at the time of the conquest, observed with astonishment the
    veneration of the natives for the Catholic rites of baptism and the
    readiness of their converts to accept this part of their teaching.
    In the course of their inquiries upon the subject they discovered
    that a form of baptism already existed, and was considered to be one
    of the most important and essential of their ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Upon
    an examination of the accounts of the manner in which the Indians
    performed their customary <span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
    rites, it does not appear that there was
    much analogy with the ceremony that was insisted upon as a duty by the
    friars, except that the Indian baptism was a religious act performed by
    their priests, in which the children were touched with something that
    had been dipped in water.</p>

  <p>The Indians, although disinclined to adopt the new faith, showed
    extraordinary ardour and devotion in this particular observance. It was
    found that they would frequently bring their children to be baptised
    again after they had already received baptism. Finally the conduct
    of the Indians in this matter became so unsatisfactory that special
    clauses upon the subject, were introduced into the laws established by
    the order of the Emperor Charles V. for the government of the Indians
    in Yucatan.</p>

  <p>One of these clauses ran thus—</p>

  <p>“Baptism is one of the sacraments which is not to be repeated, and
    if this is done great offence is committed against the Holy Ghost
    conferred upon us by baptism when it is repeated.</p>

  <p>“Many of the natives of this province say that although already
    baptised, they repeat baptism deceiving the ministers of the gospel,
    and furthermore they say that they baptise others and consent that
    others should do so. For which reason I order that henceforth no Indian
    man or woman of this province who has once received legitimately holy
    baptism shall return to be baptised or consent to others doing it, or
    baptise on their own authority any other person.”</p>

  <p>Since these orders were put in force many changes have taken place,
    and the Indians have become, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
    manner reconciled to the new order
    of things. It is, however, stated that in remote parishes the priests
    are still frequently deceived, and that children are sometimes brought
    three or four times to be given baptism.</p>

  <p>The circumstances under which the cross was placed upon the table
    in the hut near Abalá were peculiar. It was clear that the cross
    was looked upon as an idol, and that the offerings made to it were
    propitiations. In Yucatan there were instances known of several of
    the principal Indians keeping a cross in their house. This was not
    necessarily a Latin cross, for it was sometimes formed into a shape
    varying according to the imagination of the owners. The Indians are
    rapidly becoming so neglected with regard to all religious education,
    that it is not improbable that they will gradually return to many of
    their idolatrous practices.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of this century the Spanish authorities in Mexico
    ordered an inquiry to be made regarding the condition of the Yucatan
    Indians, and directions were given to ascertain whether they still
    maintained any of the superstitious usages followed before the
    conquest. There was a Report made by the curate of Yaxcabá which was
    considered to be especially deserving of mention, because he had been
    in charge of a large parish and had lived for many years among his
    Indians, and was known to be well acquainted with their language and
    habits. One of the superstitions that he reported is remarkable from
    its having evident analogies with one of the methods adopted by the
    medicine men in curing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
    the sick amongst the Dakotas in North America.
    It will be seen by his account of the custom of divining through the
    medium of a crystal, that ignorant human nature in Yucatan, as in many
    other parts of the world, seeks to learn the future by similar methods.</p>

  <p>The curate, in his reply to one of the questions put to him, stated
    as follows<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>:—“Amongst the common masses of the Indians there are
    many superstitions. In the first fifteen years that I held this curacy
    they told me much, but after making examples upon the delinquents by
    punishing them with floggings and penances in accordance with superior
    commands, it is now fully fifteen years that all is done in silence,
    and it is only from time to time that there is any sign.</p>

  <p>“The most frequent divination is by means of a piece of crystal which
    they call <i>zaztun</i>. This is a clear and transparent stone, by which
    they say that occult things are seen and the causes of sickness. What
    I have been able to understand in this matter is that they have had
    some one who, by a compact with the demon, has divined by the means
    of the said <i>zaztun</i>: but the more ordinary way is that those that
    use it are certain cheating impostors who by this means gain credit
    amongst themselves and are consulted and are well treated so that they
    have idle lives, and with their artifices and cunning make the simple
    and ignorant believe that they have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
    divined what they have secretly
    managed. I will take this example which is frequent: they make the sick
    man believe that by the means of the <i>zaztun</i> they have known that
    some malevolent person has bewitched him, and in order to discover the
    wizard or evil doer it is necessary to watch three nights and make
    preparation of ardent spirits or pitarilla, provisions and lighted
    candles; during these three nights they enjoy themselves and eat and
    drink till they are satisfied. When the others are not observing or
    asleep they bury inside the house or near it a small figure of black
    wax having a thorn run into the part corresponding to that where the
    sick person feels the most pain. Finally when all are awake they
    commence to make their operations with the <i>zaztun</i> and go straight to
    the spot where they buried the little figure, they take it out within
    sight of everybody and make them believe that this was the witchcraft.
    They then apply for the cure any herbs that they can find and if
    sometimes by chance the sick person gets cured they gain much credit
    amongst the ignorant.”</p>

  <p>A most extraordinary account was given by the curate of Yaxcabá, of
    a religious or superstitious ceremony which at a certain season of
    the year was performed by the Indians of his parish in the beginning
    of this century. They erected near the village a rudely constructed
    table upon which was placed a turkey. When the ceremony commenced, the
    Indian who acted as the priest poured into the beak of the turkey a
    small quantity of pitarilla. He then killed the bird and gave it to
    his assistants at the table, who carried it away to season it and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
    prepare it for being eaten. Large tortillas were also prepared and
    when everything was ready the turkey and tortillas were placed upon
    the table together with several jars of pitarilla. “Then,” stated the
    cura, “the sacerdote commences to incense them with copal.”... “And
    then taking some of the pitarilla upon a hissop he sprinkles it towards
    the four winds invoking the four <i>Pahahtunes</i> who are the gods and
    custodians of the rains. Then approaching the table he raises on high
    one of the jars, and offers it to the mouths of the surrounding people,
    who are kneeling. The function concludes by all eating and drinking to
    their satisfaction.”</p>

  <p>Near a hamlet a few leagues from Uxmal, I observed a group of Indians
    performing ceremonies similar to those described by the curate of
    Yaxcabá, and I then formed the opinion that they were imitating what
    they had seen in the Spanish churches. It may, however, be possible
    that these native observances have some relation to practices that
    may have been customary amongst the natives before the conquest. Near
    Jacaltenango, amongst the hills of the Sierra Madre, ceremonies and
    sacrifices were still, at certain periods of the year, performed by
    the Mams; turkeys were killed, and special and peculiar rites were
    customary. In Yucatan it was found necessary in the sixteenth century
    to enforce regulations, preventing the caciques from convening meetings
    of the natives which were held for the purpose of maintaining the
    ancient worship of their gods. These meetings usually took place in
    secret, and the services and superstitious propitiations were
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span> taught
    or performed by men who were the descendants of the priests or caciques.</p>

  <p>The tendency of the Indians to have religious rites performed in their
    houses or in huts set apart for the purpose, and their custom of having
    these ceremonies conducted by one or more men selected from among
    themselves to act as priests, or “sacerdotes,” is noticeable throughout
    Guatemala, Yucatan and Chiapas.</p>

  <p>Before leaving Abalá I visited a large and deep cenote or well. It was
    one of those natural caverns the Indians of Yucatan were accustomed to
    use for their supply of water, and which presumably mark the sites of
    the ancient centres of population. It was chiefly fed by the waters
    penetrating through the surrounding calcareous limestone formation. As
    it was late in the dry season of the year, the waters were low and the
    natives were engaged in going up and down the steps cut into and around
    the sides of the cavern. The work of filling their jars was laborious,
    as the depth to which they had to descend was nearly one hundred feet.</p>

  <p>After examining this natural well, I returned to the cabildo, where I
    found that everything was ready and the muleteers were waiting for me.
    We started without delay. At night we stopped at what appeared to be a
    farmhouse. The muleteers unloaded the mules and found places to sleep
    in an outer shed. I unrolled my hammock and secured it to the rafters
    outside the dwelling of the young proprietress, and found protection
    from the dew under the overhanging thatch. From this exposed position I
    watched for several hours the clear star-light,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span> regretting that this
    was the last time that I should lead this free and wandering life; for
    on the next day we were to be in Merida. At daybreak we continued our
    journey and arrived in the capital of Yucatan shortly before noon and
    halted in the market place.</p>

  <p>My travelling companions then left me and I remained a solitary
    stranger amongst a crowd of busy Indians. I was told that there was no
    hotel, but that possibly I might get a room in an old disused convent
    which was being altered for the purpose of receiving guests. I rode
    up to the gate and there saw a Spaniard who informed me that he had
    lately bought a portion of the ruins, and was re-arranging the interior
    sufficiently to enable him to keep an inn. He had a room at my disposal
    and assured me that he would be pleased if I would occupy it. This room
    had been a nun’s cell, the door of which opened into the quadrangle.</p>

  <p>I found that I was quartered within the Convent of the Conceptionistas,
    which after the suppression of the monastic orders had been abandoned.
    Thus, by a strange series of events, I had come from the ruined Indian
    “nunnery” at Uxmal to the ruined Spanish nunnery at Merida. The cells
    and the quadrangle of the Conceptionistas reminded me of the interior
    of the “Casa de las Monjas.”</p>

  <p>During my brief sojourn in Merida I was generally occupied during the
    day in observing the habits of the Indians who came into the town from
    the adjacent country. In the evenings, within the convent walls where,
    for many years, the nuns had led their quiet and secluded lives, I
    listened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
    the plans of my worthy and eager landlord for converting a
    building, constructed for the purposes of solitude and prayer, into a
    busy and prosperous inn. I frequently thought of the past of this land.
    The monastic institutions of an unknown race of Indians had flourished
    and had been destroyed, and were succeeded by the churches and convents
    established by an enthusiastic race of devoted missionaries who came
    across the Atlantic to spread their faith in the New World. Many
    changes had happened, the old order of things had passed away. The
    work of the Spanish priests for the education and conversion of the
    Indians, maintained for centuries with such zeal and self-sacrifice,
    was destined to become useless, and in their turn the monasteries of
    the Spaniards are doomed to fall into the same condition of ruin as the
    temples and religious structures of the Indians.</p>

  <p>One evening the landlord (Miguel Yturran) told me that a brig had
    arrived and was at anchor off the port of Sisal, and was going to sail
    for Cuba on the afternoon of the next day. I accordingly arranged to
    leave on the following morning. A good level road led to the northern
    coast, the distance was about thirty-eight miles. We changed mules at a
    village called Junucuma, and reached Sisal before nine in the morning.
    We had left Merida at daybreak and travelled at an average speed
    exceeding twelve miles an hour. In the offing we saw the brig with her
    sails loosed, preparing for sea.</p>

  <p>Upon getting on board I was told that she was the Aguinaga, belonging
    to the port of San Sebastian. She was manned by a crew of Basques.
    Shortly before weighing our anchor, I was leaning
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>over the port side
    of the vessel looking at the long, low, line of coast stretching
    far away towards the east, when my attention was called to an
    animated conversation that was taking place between the Basques and
    a boat’s-crew of Indians who had come alongside, bringing provisions
    and fruit. It was surprising to hear a conversation carried on between
    men of races so absolutely distinct, and I asked the skipper, who was
    standing near me, how this power of communicating ideas between his
    crew and these Yucatan Indians had been established.</p>

  <p>He said that he did not know, but as a matter of fact, his men,
    speaking Basque, were able to make themselves understood by the Indians
    living on these coasts, especially in the regions around Tabasco beyond
    Carmen and the bay of Terminos.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon we left Sisal and were employed in beating against a
    fresh N.E. wind, usually standing in towards the coast during the day
    and tacking out to sea at night. It was not until the sixth day that
    we weathered the parallel of Cape Catoche, the extreme eastern point
    of Yucatan, and it was with no slight satisfaction that, after having
    been nine tedious days at sea, I heard that Cuba was in sight. The
    confinement on board the brig had been extremely irksome, and had only
    been made tolerable by the novelty of being thrown amongst a race of
    men that I had never met before and whose language was unintelligible.</p>

  <p>These Basques were excellent sailors, quick and handy at their work
    aloft or on deck, and although incessantly employed, were willing and
    obedient. My messmates in the cabin consisted of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>skipper, the
    boatswain and the mate, and a fellow passenger who had been for the
    greater part of his life a Honduras pilot. There was also a second
    class passenger who usually lived under the forecastle. This man was a
    wanderer upon the earth; an exile from his own land who, in the course
    of his travels, had seen much of men and manners. He told me that he
    was a Frenchman and had been drawn for the conscription, but he managed
    to evade his duty and had got away from France, consequently he was
    not able to return to his home as he was liable to be punished. He had
    managed to subsist by following various trades and he was about to try
    his fortune in one of the islands.</p>

  <p>Upon approaching Havannah we at last got a fair wind and were able
    to find an obscure berth amongst the merchant shipping without
    difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> After leaving the brig and her Basque crew I proceeded
    across the Gulf to Florida. Amongst the various places that I visited
    was Tampa, situated at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
    the head of a bay, near the spot where Hernando
    de Soto landed in 1539 and began the conquest of that part of America.</p>

  <p>About one hundred miles to the north of Tampa are numerous sand
    islets. Upon one of these was situated the old settlement of Cedar
    Keys. I was fortunate in meeting there a good seaman and enthusiastic
    antiquary named Clarke, who had made his home at that place. He was
    well acquainted with the various channels and bays of the coast, and
    in consequence of the interest that he felt in all that related to
    the customs of the Indian tribes, had gathered together a store of
    information that was exceedingly curious. He had also made discoveries
    respecting the haunts of the buccaneers, and knew of stories about
    hidden treasure. Fragments of old vessels that were supposed to have
    belonged to the pirates had been found, and clearings in the forest had
    been noticed, where it is supposed they formed their camps when the
    crews were landed. This part of the Florida coast with its tortuous
    channels and land-locked bays is precisely the position that buccaneers
    would have chosen for careening their vessels and for all purposes that
    required concealment after their raids upon the Spaniards.</p>

  <p>Upon one of the islands near the main-land there was an ancient kitchen
    midden or shell mound of unusual size. We found that it extended along
    the beach for eight hundred yards. It averaged eighty yards in width
    and was forty feet high. It was composed principally of large oyster
    shells, but there were also the shells of clam fish and numerous
    smaller shells. The mound throughout
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>its length presented on its face
    a series of alternate layers of earth, about half-an-inch thick. The
    thickness of these intervening deposits of shells was greater than at
    Damariscotta in Maine, from which fact it may be inferred that the
    tribes who came here were more numerous, or that they were capable
    of extraordinary powers of consuming oysters. Upon cutting away
    portions of the outer slope of the mound, we found many fish bones and
    quantities of fragments of broken pottery.</p>

  <p>Not far from the shell mound was an ancient Indian burial place.
    Captain Clarke had made excavations into it, and amongst the
    accumulation of bones he had found some flint arrow heads and a few
    rude stone axes. I examined these and noticed that they were similar
    to those that had been found in several of the burial mounds of the
    Iroquois. As I wished to see this mound for the purpose of ascertaining
    certain points respecting the methods of burial adopted by the Florida
    Indians, Captain Clarke proposed that we should make an examination of
    it.</p>

  <p>The heap was irregular in shape and about four hundred yards in
    circumference at the base. It consisted entirely of quantities of human
    skulls and bones. We examined it sufficiently to enable certain facts
    to be made clear. From the manner in which groups of skulls and thigh
    bones were placed and separated, it was evident that the burials took
    place at considerable intervals of time. This is in accordance with
    what is known of the funeral customs of the Indians in Florida and the
    southern parts of the Mississippi Valley at the time of the expedition
    of De Soto.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

  <p>It was then ascertained that in each of the villages there was a large
    building in which were kept boxes containing human bones. Before the
    bones were collected in this manner, the bodies had been placed in
    the adjacent forest, exposed to the air but raised on a scaffolding
    sufficiently high to prevent them from being disturbed by wild animals.
    After a suitable time had elapsed the bones were separated and
    cleaned, and were then deposited in the charnel-house, where religious
    ceremonies were frequently performed. Upon certain occasions, when the
    boxes were getting full, the bones were taken away and conveyed to the
    tribal burial place.</p>

  <p>Judging from the manner in which the bones were deposited in the mound,
    it is probable that they were brought in their separate cases, and that
    the contents of each case were carefully kept together and finally
    thrown out in separate heaps. The occasions when the bones were brought
    here, may have been those when the tribes made their migrations to
    the seacoast. The methods of cleaning and removing the bones of the
    Indians in Florida were similar to those of the Dakotas.</p>

  <p>On the coast, a few miles north of Cedar Keys, there were other large
    shell mounds, and in Tampa Bay I was shown the position of a long and
    extensive range of similar heaps on its southern shores. It is evident
    that before the sixteenth century there must have been a numerous
    aboriginal race inhabiting these coasts. The scattered remnants of the
    tribes that remained in Florida at the conclusion of the last Indian
    war in this region, have been removed and placed upon lands beyond the
    Mississippi.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the following chapters I propose to bring together the various notes
    upon the Indians and their temples and earthworks which were made when
    traversing Central America, and to add to them the conclusions which
    have been formed subsequently.</p>

  <p>There are certain problems which particularly require to be examined.
    With respect to the antiquity of the stone buildings and pyramids,
    it would be difficult to attempt to do more than endeavour to form
    reasonable deductions from the evidence afforded by the state of those
    ruins, and the information given about them by the Indians at the time
    of the conquest. The conquerors, after they had settled in Yucatan and
    Guatemala, were accompanied by Spanish missionaries of great ability.
    We possess in the writings of Bishop Las Casas and Bishop Landa works
    of the greatest value, for both those prelates when they were engaged
    in their duties of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
    converting the natives, were acquainted with the
    language of the tribes amongst whom they worked.</p>

  <p>In the prosecution of researches into subjects which relate to Central
    America, it is desirable as a preliminary step to consider the
    comparative civilisation of the Indians, as far as that is brought
    into evidence by what has been discovered with respect to mounds and
    earthworks, not only in that region, but also throughout the valley of
    the Mississippi. A distinction must also be made between earthworks
    which are unquestionably of great antiquity, and those that possibly
    may have been raised since the date of the arrival of European
    settlers. Therefore the geometrically planned inclosures in Ohio should
    be excluded from this inquiry. It is otherwise with great ramparts such
    as those inclosing Fort Ancient on the steep promontory in the valley
    of the Little Miami, which are of special importance on account of the
    parallelisms with the similar fortifications made by the Quichés and
    Kachiquels in Guatemala.</p>

  <p>There are exceptional circumstances connected with the mounds in North
    America. It has to be remembered that they were not always burial
    places. When De Soto arrived with his fleet in Florida, the chief
    cacique of the tribe dwelling near the landing place, was living on the
    top of a mound about fifty feet high. This mound was pointed out to me
    when I was at Tampa. It appeared to be made for the purpose of placing
    huts upon its summit. The platform was sufficiently large to give room
    for several dwellings. There are also mounds near the western bank of
    the Mississippi, between Natchez and the mouth of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span> Arkansas. One of
    them resembled that at Tampa, and had a wide level space on the summit.</p>

  <p>When the earliest Spanish expedition passed through that part of the
    country, it was observed that the Indians frequently placed their
    houses upon artificial earthworks raised sufficiently high to be above
    the inundations. At Natchez the tribe, which, from their peculiar
    customs, have been called the sun worshippers, raised mounds primarily
    for the residence of their chiefs, who differed from other Indians of
    that rank, in being invested with special attributes in connection with
    ceremonies performed before the rising sun. But there were customs with
    respect to them which require to be noticed. It was stated by Father le
    Petit, who was for many years a missionary amongst the Natchez, that
    when their principal chief died his hut was demolished and a new mound
    was raised, upon which was built the wooden cabin of his successor in
    that dignity. It can be understood that where a large tribe having
    this custom dwelt for a long time in one place, it might happen that
    a series of connected platform mounds, forming an inclosure, would
    probably have a rectangular shape.</p>

  <p>Higher up the Mississippi, above the junction of the Ohio, are the
    Cahokia earthworks. There were also several mounds placed on high
    ground near the east bank of the river, not far from the borders of
    Illinois and Wisconsin. One of these, which was about forty feet
    high, was opened ten years before I went to St. Paul’s. A vault was
    discovered beneath the level of the ground, which contained several
    skeletons sitting in a circle. The earth of which it
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span> was composed was
    a kind of loam, not occurring in the vicinity, and it was supposed
    that it must have been brought from a considerable distance by Indians
    who wished to show their respect for the burial place of their chiefs,
    by bringing tributes of earth taken from the ground near their
    encampments. The high mounds placed around the edge of the promontory,
    now called Dayton’s Bluff, and which are the most northern group in the
    valley of the Mississippi, have been described in a preceding chapter.</p>

  <p>When I was in Chiapas, the Presbitero Macal told me that he was present
    when two mounds were examined in 1860, near San Cristobal. They were
    each ten feet high and covered vaults made of large flat slabs of
    stone. Within these tombs were two skulls, but nothing else was found.
    There were no weapons or fragments of pottery. In the vault under the
    mound in Illinois there were several large pieces of pottery, and on
    the surface, immediately above the tomb, were ashes and other evidences
    of fire.</p>

  <p>But before proceeding farther with this subject, it is necessary to
    bring under consideration the progress of archæological knowledge in
    North America, since the date of my visit to the ancient mounds and
    earthworks in Ohio. Great advances have been made in the classification
    of the discoveries that have taken place in the burial mounds that
    exist throughout the United States. Deductions can consequently be
    established with regard to the civilisation of the Indians, and it has
    become possible to establish, upon a scientific basis, their position
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
    as a race. A long series of investigations have been completed, and a
    summary of the results published, under the auspices of the Smithsonian
    Institution, by Professor Cyrus Thomas.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

  <p>“It seems desirable at the present time,” he observes, “to make a
    statement explaining the plans and describing the work of the mound
    exploring division of the Bureau of Ethnology.”... “The questions
    relating to prehistoric America are to be determined not alone by
    the study of its ancient monuments, but by the study also of the
    languages, customs, art, beliefs, and folk-lore of the aborigines.
    Only by such a comprehensive study can the exact relations of the
    ancient archæological remains to the historic Indian tribes be made
    apparent. Major J. W. Powell, the Director of the Bureau, taking this
    comprehensive and scientific view of the subject, saw at the outset the
    necessity of deciding as soon as possible the question ‘Were the mound
    builders Indians?’”</p>

  <p>The work was carried on for several years, and Professor Thomas states
    that “Over two thousand mounds have been explored, including almost
    every known type as to form.... Nothing trustworthy has been discovered
    to justify the theory that the mound builders belonged to a highly
    civilised race, or that they were a people who had attained a higher
    culture status than the Indians. It is true that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>works and papers
    on American archæology are full of statements to the contrary, which
    are generally based on the theory that the mound builders belonged to
    a race of much higher culture than the Indians. Yet when the facts
    on which this opinion is based are examined with sober, scientific
    care, the splendid fabric which has been built upon them by that
    great workman, imagination, fades from sight.” Professor Thomas also
    observes—“That the links discovered directly connecting the Indians and
    mound builders are so numerous and well established that there should
    be no longer any hesitancy in accepting the theory that the two are one
    and the same people.”</p>

  <p>The origin and nature of the American mounds, and the customs of the
    Indians who raised them, have also been investigated by Professor
    Lucien Carr. He claims “that the mounds and inclosures of Ohio, like
    those in New York and the Gulf States, were the work of the red Indians
    of historic times, or of their immediate ancestors.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

  <p>With reference to this much debated question of the formation of these
    inclosures, a re-survey of several of them was made. The measurements
    of Professor Thomas and his assistants appear to have established the
    fact of the geometrical accuracy of the octagonal, square and circular
    works near <span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
    Newark.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In the introduction to the memoir upon the
    Ohio mounds, Professor Thomas observes that “The constantly recurring
    question ‘Who constructed these works?’ has brought before the public
    a number of widely different theories, though the one which has been
    most generally accepted is that they originated with a people long
    since extinct or driven from the country, who had attained a culture
    status much in advance of that reached by the aborigines inhabiting
    the country at the time of its discovery by Europeans. The opinions
    advanced in this paper, in support of which evidence will be presented,
    is that the ancient works of the State are due to Indians of several
    different tribes, and that some at least of the typical works, were
    built by the ancestors of the modern Cherokees.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

  <p>As a consequence of the examination of the Indian mounds throughout
    the United States, the majority of the modern American archæologists
    consider that the aboriginal inhabitants were never in a higher
    state of civilisation than they were when they first became known to
    Europeans. It is not however the questions of the burial mounds, and
    the importance of what has been found in them which have chiefly to
    be considered here. Attention should be principally
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span> directed to the
    difficult problem respecting the great fortified ramparts of Fort
    Ancient.</p>

  <p>The traditions of the Delawares,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> which affirmed that the defensive
    earthworks of Ohio were built by the Tallegwi, have generally been
    accepted as being well founded. They were stated to have been a
    powerful tribe who built fortifications and entrenchments. Finally
    they abandoned their lands and went southwards, down the valley of the
    Mississippi and never returned. It may be conjectured, after observing
    the similar works and methods of selecting their defensive positions
    in Guatemala, that the Tallegwi were the same race who were afterwards
    known as Toltecs. The probability of this assumption being reasonable,
    becomes more evident when the group of platform and circular mounds on
    the plains near Mixco are observed to be similar to those raised on the
    plains of Cahokia near the banks of the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>The question of the condition of intelligence amongst the North
    American Indians, has a direct bearing upon the problem of the origin
    of the civilisation of the Toltecs and Aztecs, and it is satisfactory
    to know that there are sound reasons for supposing that the Indians
    who constructed the fortified camps in Ohio were not more advanced in
    knowledge than the tribes who were dwelling in that region at the time
    of the discovery of America by Columbus.</p>

  <p>Several years after the conquest of Mexico, the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>Spaniards sent
    expeditions into the southern parts of Central America, and conquered
    the Quichés and the surrounding country, in which were situated
    the ramparts defending Utatlan and Patinamit. It was subsequently
    considered desirable that investigations should be made into the
    ancient systems by which the aboriginal inhabitants had been governed
    by their caciques, and orders were given to this effect by the Emperor
    Charles the Fifth and by his successor Philip the Second. In the
    reports of the officers who conducted these inquiries, it was stated
    that an extraordinarily rigid line of caste was maintained amongst the
    Quichés. There was an absolute distinction between the ruling families
    descended from the caciques, and the great mass of the races who were
    under their control. It was also evident, judging from the language of
    several appeals made by Indian chiefs to obtain justice and to have
    their rank and authority acknowledged, that they considered the working
    classes of Indians as their absolute slaves.</p>

  <p>“There was no instance,” states the historian Juarros, “of any person
    being appointed to a public office, high or low, who was not selected
    from the nobility; for which reason, great anxiety was felt by them
    to keep the purity of their lineage unsullied. To preserve this rank
    untainted in blood, it was decreed by the law, that if any cacique
    or noble should marry a woman who was not of noble family, he should
    be degraded to the caste of mazegual or plebeian, assume the name of
    his wife, and be subject to all the duties and services imposed upon
    plebeians.” These services generally consisted of works
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span> performed
    by forced labour. The lands belonging to the ruling families were
    cultivated in this manner, and, in fact, the Indians of the native
    and working class were entirely at the disposal of their masters. One
    of the Spanish bishops, whose diocese was in Mexico, mentions that he
    had ascertained that these mazeguales could be sold or killed by their
    owners. There were marked differences in the dress of the people. The
    mazeguales wore, as a rule, nothing but the loin cloth, or sometimes,
    as is the case now with the Lacandones, a long cotton shirt, reaching
    nearly to the feet. It was a matter of observation amongst the
    conquerors that the inferior classes of Indians were submissive, but
    that their rulers were intractable, harsh and warlike.</p>

  <p>It is inexpedient to pursue this particular subject to any great
    extent, for it is made clear by the reports of the Spanish authorities
    that the relations of the governing class of the Quichés to the
    other Indians under their rule were those of a race of conquerors
    to a race of slaves, and the victors treated those whom they had
    conquered in a manner in accordance with the habits of a savage and
    barbarous tribe of North American Indians. This much may be admitted
    from the consideration of the circumstances of the laws and customs
    of the Quichés at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards. But if a
    due estimation is also given to the evidence afforded by the strange
    and otherwise inexplicable similarities in the methods of choosing
    fortified positions and raising ramparts with those in Ohio, it becomes
    reasonable to infer that the Quiché chiefs originally migrated from
    that part of North America.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

  <p>It is however necessary to note that, at whatever period their
    migration may have taken place, it cannot be granted or inferred that
    the Ohio tribes brought with them any knowledge of architecture, or
    of any form of civilisation, for had it been otherwise, they would
    have left behind them some vestiges of that civilisation or mechanical
    skill. It is especially remarkable that throughout the length and
    breadth of North America there is not the smallest fragment of any
    hewn stone building, or of any carved stone hieroglyphic characters.
    Thus the theory of migratory tribes of Indians bringing with them from
    the North into Mexico, a comparatively advanced knowledge of arts
    and sciences is opposed to all evidence. It is almost certain that
    the state of civilisation that at one time existed in the regions of
    Chiapas and Yucatan, was introduced into the country at some period
    subsequent to the arrival of the invading tribe, unless it can be
    established that the aboriginal races already possessed a competent
    intelligence, and an architectural capacity. A proposition of this
    character cannot be reasonably maintained, for it is known that in
    the fifteenth century the Indians in Cuba and Haiti, the Caribs on
    the coasts south of Yucatan, and the aborigines in the interior were
    savages, existing in a low state of human intelligence. This subject
    respecting the Indian migrations and the state of civilisation that was
    existing, or had existed, in Central America, can be more definitely
    considered after attention has been directed to the question of the
    antiquity and purpose of the buildings at Palenque and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span> Uxmal. It is
    much to be regretted that Palenque was not known to the Spaniards when
    Cortes marched within a few leagues of it in 1524. Possibly, at that
    time it had not been long abandoned, and perhaps some of the caciques
    dwelling in that part of the valley of the Usamacinta might have been
    able to explain the meaning of the hieroglyphs. Unfortunately the
    ruins were not discovered until more than two centuries had elapsed,
    and nothing could be ascertained from the Indians which gave the
    slightest clue to their signification. It has been surmised—and there
    are good reasons for thinking that the surmise may be correct—that the
    characters relate to the migrations of the tribes. But in consequence
    of the incomplete knowledge of these Indian hieroglyphs, it would be
    impossible to attempt to form any satisfactory conjectures regarding
    their meaning.</p>

  <p>There exists, however, graven on the tablet of the cross, two figures
    which, if I am correct in my opinion with regard to them, are of the
    greatest importance in establishing certain facts with regard to the
    builders of Palenque. Upon referring to the illustration of the altar
    tablet that was placed within the temple of the cross, it will be
    noticed that the two standing figures offering sacrifice to the quetzal
    or sacred bird of Quiché, are evidently intended to represent persons
    actually living at the time that the altar was designed, for there is
    nothing fantastic in the costume that is worn by them. If a careful
    examination is made into the details of their dress it will, I think,
    be concluded that these men were the chief caciques of the Quichés.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>

  <p>“The nobles,” observes Juarros, “wore a dress of white cotton dyed or
    stained with different colours, the use of which was prohibited to the
    other ranks. This vestment consisted of a shirt and white breeches,
    decorated with fringes; over these was drawn another pair of breeches,
    reaching to the knees and ornamented with a species of embroidery;
    the legs were bare; the feet protected by sandals, fastened over the
    instep and at the heel by thongs of leather; the sleeves of the shirt
    were looped above the elbow, with a blue or red band; the hair was
    worn long, and tressed behind with a cord of the colour used upon the
    sleeves, and terminating in a tassel, which was a distinction peculiar
    to the great captains; the waist was girded with a piece of cloth of
    various colours, fastened in a knot before; over the shoulders was
    thrown a white mantle, ornamented with figures of birds, lions and
    other decorations of cord and fringe. The ears and lower lip were
    pierced, to receive star-shaped pendants of gold or silver.”</p>

  <p>Upon an examination of the figures it will be observed that, although
    their dress corresponds with what is described as being worn by the
    Quiché caciques, neither of them are wearing sandals. But, on the
    altar of the temple placed on an adjacent mound, the same figures are
    again offering sacrifices, and the tallest of them is wearing sandals
    precisely as described above. It was the custom among the Quichés
    to associate with the principal cacique another chief, to whom was
    intrusted the control and management of the troops and the conduct of
    all hostilities, and it is stated that sometimes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
    this chief was the
    eldest son of the cacique. As the second temple appears to have been
    dedicated to the god of war, it may be assumed that the shorter figure
    was intended to represent a war chief. He is dressed in accordance
    with that rank and wears a mantle and a heavy tassel. In this temple
    the chief is drawn as standing upon a kneeling captive, but in that
    dedicated to Quetzalcoatl he is placed upon a block of stone, upon
    which is a hieroglyph. To Quetzalcoatl the offering appears to have
    been in conformity with the attributes assigned to him, of religion
    and education. Possibly the child, held in the hands of the tallest
    cacique, was dedicated to serve in the temple after having been trained
    for the priesthood in the monastery.</p>

    <div class="caption smcap">Part of the Altar-piece in a Temple at Palenque.</div>
  </div>

  <p>It is satisfactory to be able to establish the conclusion that the
    figures are caciques of the Quichés, for it thereby becomes possible to
    advance a few steps towards the solution of a problem which presents
    many difficulties with regard to the period of the construction of
    Palenque, and state of civilization of the builders. In a manuscript
    left in a Franciscan convent by one of the descendants of the Quichés,
    an account was given of the migrations of that tribe before they
    settled near Utatlan. It was stated that they reached that country
    after a long journey from Mexico, and adopted the name of Quiché in
    memory of one of their leaders; but before that time the people were
    called Toltecs.</p>

  <p>Before endeavouring to establish conclusions with regard to Palenque,
    attention should be directed to the temples and other stone buildings
    in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
    adjacent regions. With respect to the numerous groups of
    ruins in Yucatan, we possess the testimony of the Spanish priests who
    dwelt in their parishes in that country at a period when many of the
    governing class of Indians were of the same generation as those who
    inhabited the land when it was conquered. One of these missionaries
    was Father Landa, who was not only zealous in the performance of his
    duties, but also studied the language and civilisation of the race
    amongst whom he dwelt. He was present in Tihoo soon after the capture
    of that Indian settlement, which was afterwards chosen for the site of
    the city of Merida.</p>

  <p>He states that in that place there were several stone edifices. He made
    a plan of the largest of them from which it is evident that they were
    of the same character as those at Uxmal. Tihoo was occupied by the
    Spanish forces in 1541, and the terraces, upon which were placed the
    principal buildings, were given to the Franciscans as a site for their
    convent. The friars began their work in 1547. Thus only six years had
    elapsed since the Indians had left their town. Landa’s descriptions
    of the state and condition of the ancient ruins are therefore of the
    greatest assistance in forming conclusions with regard to them.</p>

  <p>The principal edifice was placed upon the highest of three terraces,
    each of which was surrounded or faced by thick walls, and approached
    by steps. There was a large interior quadrangle having ranges of
    rooms or cells occupying the four sides. These were similar to those
    in the “House of the Nuns” at Uxmal. In the vicinity there were
    several pyramids <span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
    which had small temples on their summits. It was
    observed that all these structures appeared to have been disused for a
    considerable period. The Franciscans found that the Indian structures
    were covered with thick brushwood. This was cleared away. The buildings
    were destroyed and the materials supplied the stone required for their
    church and convent.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

  <p>The fact that the desertion of the temples had occurred before the
    arrival of the Spaniards is important. It explains many of the
    circumstances then existing in Yucatan which otherwise would be
    unintelligible. When the conquerors settled in that land they were
    surprised to find numerous stone buildings in various parts of the
    country, all of which were unoccupied. They were informed that they had
    not been abandoned in consequence of their conquest. They found that
    it was impracticable to obtain from the natives any explanation of the
    nature of the events which had happened and had caused this change.
    Thus the problem regarding the purposes of these extensive buildings,
    and the architectural skill of the constructors was as obscure to them
    at that time as it is now to the present inhabitants.</p>

  <p>At Izamal, about thirty-five miles east of Tihoo, there were also
    numerous temples, and it was noticed by Landa that there were evidences
    of there having been a paved road between the two
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>places. A Franciscan
    convent was established at Izamal, and a brief account of its temples
    was written in 1663 by Father Lizana, in which he states, with respect
    to the ruins in Yucatan, that the deserted edifices appeared to
    have been of one style of architecture, and that some of them were
    so perfect that it might be said that twenty years had not elapsed
    since they were built. These edifices were however, he observes, not
    inhabited by the Indians when the Spaniards arrived. The natives lived
    scattered in huts amongst the woods, but they used them as temples or
    sanctuaries, and occasionally performed religious ceremonies and fasts
    there.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

  <p>The Franciscan missionaries were not able to obtain from the natives
    an intelligible explanation of the events that had occurred which had
    caused the temples to be abandoned. But they were informed that an
    invasion had taken place about two hundred years before their arrival,
    and many of the caciques and ruling families had been driven out of the
    land. The invaders did not occupy the sacred buildings, and allowed
    them to fall into ruin, but they were visited occasionally by those who
    still had faith in the ancient gods and wished to offer sacrifices to
    them. It was ascertained that the greater part of Yucatan had become
    subject to the control of chiefs belonging to the Aztec race, and that
    several of them paid tribute to Montezuma.</p>

  <p>The question of the antiquity of the temples of Palenque, Uxmal and
    other structures of that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
    character must therefore, in a great degree,
    be decided by the evidence upon which are based the traditions of the
    migrations of the Toltecs who preceded the Aztecs, and were the first
    of the hordes who conquered the aboriginal races of Central America.
    The historians who have investigated those traditions concur in
    considering that the arrival of the Toltecs within Mexican territory
    happened in the seventh century. After remaining some time in the
    northern part of the country, they migrated southwards to Cholula,
    Palenque and Yucatan.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> If the historic evidence is accepted as
    being trustworthy, it follows that all the stone edifices in these
    regions must have been erected later than that date. The Aztecs arrived
    at the close of the twelfth century. Therefore it may be concluded that
    Palenque was built later than the eighth century, and was deserted
    before the fourteenth century. Uxmal is evidently more modern than
    Palenque, and it may be assumed that it was constructed after the tenth
    century, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
    abandoned not much earlier than a hundred years before
    the Spaniards landed upon the shores of the New World.</p>

  <p>The Aztec chiefs introduced into Yucatan one of their barbarous
    customs which was similar to what was practised by them elsewhere.
    It was found by the conquerors, that in Mexico they kept slaves and
    prisoners in cages, where these victims were fattened and prepared for
    sacrifice.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> After having been killed and offered as propitiations
    to the gods their bodies were eaten. In 1511, it happened that a
    Spanish vessel was wrecked upon some shoals fifteen leagues south of
    the island of Jamaica. The crew after having
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>been thirteen days in
    an open boat, landed upon the north-eastern shores of Yucatan near
    Cape Catoche, and were made captives by the cacique of the district.
    Valdivia, who was in command, together with four of his men, were at
    once sacrificed and eaten, others were put in cages, but several of
    these men escaped. When the fleet under the command of Cortes anchored
    off Cozumel, in 1519, one of the captives, named Aguilar, went on board
    the flagship.</p>

  <p>Bernal Diaz, who was with the expedition and saw this man when he
    arrived, relates that when Aguilar came before the presence of Cortes
    he cowered down according to the manner of Indian slaves. Aguilar
    stated that only he and another Spaniard named Gonzalo Guerrero, were
    then alive. Most of his companions had been sacrificed to the gods,
    but some had died, and two women who were with them had perished from
    misery and the severity of the labour of grinding maize. Guerrero had
    married an Indian woman and followed the native customs. He had been
    tattoed, his ears were pierced and his lips were turned down.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
    Aguilar had become acquainted with the Maya language, and was
    afterwards employed by Cortes as an interpreter. Guerrero remained in
    Yucatan with the Indians.</p>

  <p>Upon a review of the facts ascertained by the conquerors in the
    sixteenth century in Mexico and Guatemala, and by the Franciscan and
    Dominican <span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
    missionaries in Yucatan and Chiapas, together with the
    researches made since that time by archæologists and explorers, it
    appears to be possible to form certain conclusions. The architectural
    and mechanical knowledge, and the advance towards writing characters,
    forming calendars and reckoning time by astronomical observations must
    have been reached within a period of less than four centuries. It is
    therefore probable that the priests of the Toltecs became acquainted
    with their arts and sciences not long after they had left North America
    and had migrated to the regions around Téotihuacan in the direction
    of the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In what manner and under what
    circumstances their knowledge was obtained, is a problem which requires
    to be given a careful investigation.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <blockquote>
    <p>In an Aztec or Toltec manuscript which forms part of the
      collection of ancient Mexican codices placed in the library of
      the Vatican, there is a representation of a cacique making an
      offering to a rattlesnake.</p>

    <p>The manner of propitiation resembles the methods of sacrificing
      to this Manito which were followed by the Dakotas (see p. 170).
      The head dress of the cacique which consists of plumed feathers
      is similar to that worn by the chiefs of that race, and is
      placed in the same position as the feathers of Rocky Bear
      (illustration, chapter viii).</p>

    <p>The rattlesnake appears to have been the Totem of the Toltecs
      and is the chief emblem at Uxmal and Chichen Itza.</p>

    <p>It is thought that a serpent is represented upon the central
      stone of the tablet of the cross at Palenque and as the
      god to whom the temple is dedicated was named Bird-Serpent
      (Quetzal-Coatl), it is probable that the sculptors delineated
      the symbol in a manner that was intelligible to the Quichés.</p>

    <p>Upon an examination of the illustration of the centre tablet,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
      which is an exact reproduction from a photograph of the
      original stone (see frontispiece), these symbols may perhaps
      be traced. I may here venture to express the opinion that the
      Toltecs may have been the tribe that once dwelt in that part of
      Ohio to the west of the river Scioto, where is still to be seen
      the Totem of the serpent.</p>

    <p>The illustration of the propitiation to the serpent is taken
      from a part of the Mexican manuscript represented in Humboldt’s
      “Vues des Cordilléres.”</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of the origin and migrations of the Toltecs has been given
    much attention. It has been a matter of conjecture whether any of
    the descendants of the people who built the temples of Palenque, and
    inscribed upon tablets of stone their hieroglyphic records, are at
    present living in Central America.</p>

  <p>The chief difficulty in attempting to form a decision upon this
    question, is the uncertainty regarding the distinction to be made
    between the people belonging to the conquering Quichés and the
    aboriginal races whom they had reduced to slavery, and who constituted
    the greater part of the population. It is known that the caciques and
    other members of the governing families of Utatlan became gradually
    reduced to the utmost poverty. But there were other chiefs of tribes of
    Quiché origin who did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
    not resist the Spaniards, and who volunteered
    to become their allies. Many of these were permitted to hold lands in
    the neighbourhood of Lake Atitlan, and lived in a prosperous condition
    until the early part of the eighteenth century, when they disappeared
    from notice. Possibly, in accordance with Quiché customs, they may have
    kept apart from those who were mazeguales, and intermarried amongst
    Indians of the same race as themselves.</p>

  <p>The statements of the grandsons of the caciques of Utatlan, as recorded
    in their manuscripts, with regard to the dates of the arrival of their
    tribe, the building of the fortresses, and their system of dividing the
    country they had conquered into separate governments, are undoubtedly
    entitled to be considered as deserving of attention. They agree in
    a remarkable manner with what has been since ascertained. It may be
    inferred from the account of their migrations and the list of their
    kings or chief caciques, that they had been settled in Guatemala about
    three or four hundred years before Utatlan was conquered by Alvarado.</p>

  <p>During the time that I was crossing the Cordilleras in the region
    which had been governed by the Quichés, I endeavoured to ascertain if
    there were any marked differences in the types or characters of the
    tribes then occupying the land. Near Patinamit I saw several groups of
    Kachiquels who were of the same race as the Quichés, and I noticed that
    in many respects they resembled the Dakotas, and in appearance were
    unlike the ordinary natives. I also observed in the district adjacent
    to Santa Cruz del Quiché that the Indians holding official positions
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
    in the villages were usually of a larger stature than the inferior men
    and, in their harsh and overbearing manner and features, recalled to
    mind the chiefs of the North American tribes. I found, however, that it
    was not possible to form definite conclusions based upon the facts that
    came within my personal observation. The Quichés are reserved in their
    intercourse with strangers. Whatever may be their comparative condition
    of wealth or poverty they all live in the same manner, and seem to be
    satisfied with the barest necessaries. Near Jacaltenango, when amongst
    the Mams, I met one of the richest and most influential of the Indians
    of that tribe. He was living like the meanest of the people, although
    he was the owner of a prosperous estate. This apparent equality in the
    habits of life is universal amongst the Indians.</p>

  <p>In the sixteenth century, after the conquest, the caciques of the
    Quichés and Mams who had submitted to the Spaniards were accustomed
    to maintain a state ceremonial of considerable dignity; and at a
    later period the Indians who claimed to have held high rank and who
    were granted lands and privileges lived in a manner suitable to their
    condition. This comparative distinction has entirely disappeared. With
    respect to the migrations of the governing classes of the Quichés it is
    a matter of interest to observe that several of the Indian chiefs who
    accompanied the Spanish conquerors from Mexico, married the daughters
    of these Quichés, and said that they did so because they had discovered
    that they were of the same race as themselves.</p>

  <p>In the consideration of subjects relating to the Indians it is
    necessary to discriminate between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
    observances of the aboriginal
    inhabitants and those of the races who were of foreign origin. Thus
    with respect to the superstitious and extremely devotional inclinations
    of the natives in Guatemala and Chiapas, it may be assumed that those
    instincts belong to the race who dwelt in those lands before they were
    conquered by the Toltecs and Aztecs; but the customs of sacrificing
    human beings to the gods together with other acts of barbarity were
    introduced from North America.</p>

  <p>The Spaniards considered that the most evident proclivities of the
    masses of the natives were drunkenness and idolatry. The latter
    tendency prevailed to an excessive degree. Las Casas states that
    throughout New Spain the idols were so numerous that they could not
    be counted. During his journeys he found them in every place and of
    every kind, in their huts, in the villages, amongst the hills and in
    the sacred places. The numbers of them, he relates, were infinite.
    In the sixteenth century the Indians were gradually, but not without
    difficulty, brought under the control of the Spanish ecclesiastics. The
    idols were destroyed, and the superstitious practices, especially all
    those which were connected with the worship of demons, were suppressed.</p>

  <p>The national instinct of idolatry still remains. There is in the
    nature of the aboriginal races a religious fervour which apparently
    forms an integral part of their character. They are also submissive
    and inoffensive, and it can be understood how any invading and warlike
    tribe would, without difficulty, conquer and control people having
    this mild disposition. It is not surprising that a fierce tribe of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
    North American Indians was able to reduce them into a state of servile
    obedience. The Toltecs and, afterwards, the Aztecs would undoubtedly
    have introduced into Mexico the barbarous usages which prevailed
    amongst the tribes dwelling in the valleys of the Mississippi and Ohio,
    and these usages, when grafted upon the vices which existed amongst the
    natives, may have been the inciting cause of the revolting condition of
    national demoralisation which was so severely described by Bernal Diaz
    and other Spanish historians.</p>

  <p>The Dominican missionaries in Guatemala observed that the Indians
    were passionately fond of dancing and singing. The joyousness which
    originally existed in their nature or temperament has become extinct.
    The usual tenour of their lives seems to be accompanied by a quiet,
    subdued melancholy. It is not improbable that, as a consequence of
    several centuries of Spanish domination, the aboriginal races have
    sunk into a dull and apathetic state. It is however possible that
    other influences acted upon the taciturn and wild natures of these
    tribes.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The innate disposition of the natives to worship idols
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>in
    Guatemala was found to be equally existing with the Mayas in Yucatan,
    who also had the custom of making pilgrimages to the shrines. It is
    mentioned by Landa that the pilgrims stopped when passing near any of
    the deserted or ruined temples, and were accustomed to mutter prayers,
    and offer incense. This custom was in accordance with the acts of
    devotion which I saw practised by the Tzendal Indians in Chiapas before
    the ruined walls of the church at Bachajon.</p>

  <p>There are circumstances connected with the domination of the Aztecs,
    and possibly also with that of their predecessors the Quiché-Toltecs,
    which require to be noticed. It is unquestionable that slavery would
    have been the fate of any tribe or race conquered by North American
    Indians. But the fact of slaves or captives being bought and sold for
    the purpose of being killed and offered to the gods is extraordinary.
    Great numbers of the natives were annually sacrificed, and astonishing
    acts of cannibalism were committed. Whatever may have been the
    hardships inflicted by the Spaniards upon the Mexican Indians, it is
    satisfactory to be assured that the discovery of America, and the
    conquests of Cortes put an end to the most horrible condition of things
    that has ever been known to have existed in any part of the world.</p>

  <p>There are, however, other facts to be taken into consideration. It has
    been assumed that there was a condition of comparative civilisation
    amongst the ruling tribes, which seemed to be in such a progressive
    state as to lead to the conclusion that there were elements of
    knowledge which might have been so far
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span> developed in the course of
    time as to have brought these Indians into the ranks of civilised
    nations. With regard to this subject it should be observed that when
    the Spaniards conquered Central America, the progress that may have
    been partially made had already ceased. The monasteries at Palenque and
    in Yucatan had been abandoned. Even when they were flourishing, the
    knowledge that was taught did not extend to the people. It was confined
    to the priesthood, the caciques, and the few scholars who were trained
    for the purpose of interpreting the signs and characters by which
    information was spread abroad. It was by one of these interpreters that
    Cortes was made acquainted with the conspiracy that was being organized
    against him by Guatimozin during the march to Honduras. How or in what
    manner this comparative intelligence arose suddenly in the land is a
    problem of the greatest difficulty.</p>

  <p>The possibility of a previous condition of civilisation having existed
    amongst the aboriginal tribes cannot be considered as being within the
    limits of reasonable conjecture, for there are no vestiges of any stone
    buildings, sculptures, or of hieroglyphic inscribed characters, used as
    a means of recording events, except in those regions which are known
    to have been occupied by the Toltecs or Aztecs. With especial regard
    to the temples on the mounds at Palenque, it is evident that these and
    their sculptures and hieroglyphs were the results of a certain degree
    of architectural knowledge obtained by the Quiché-Toltecs after they
    had migrated into Mexico.</p>

  <p>But admitting that this may have been the case, it becomes extremely
    difficult to understand how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
    their mechanical skill could have sprung
    into existence within such a limited period of time. It was found
    that the Indian progress in their peculiar civilisation was very
    local. Bishop Landa, writing exclusively about Yucatan, states that
    all education was under the management of the priests attached to the
    monasteries. Similar systems appeared to have been followed in other
    regions which had been under the rule of the Toltecs.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The results
    of the investigations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
    into the subject of the extent and methods which
    were adopted for the purpose of maintaining knowledge amongst the
    Indians, confirm the opinion that the literature and civilisation found
    to have existed in Mexico and Yucatan was exclusively caused by the
    teaching of the priests.</p>

  <p>Explanations of the circumstances under which the priests became
    acquainted with their sciences were given to the Spaniards by the chief
    priests attached to the temple of Quetzalcoatl at Cholula and also by
    certain caciques in Yucatan.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption smcap">Mexican Calendar Stone.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span></p>

  <p>Las Casas relates that when he was making a journey within his diocese,
    he met one of his missionaries named Francisco Hernandez, who had been
    for some years living in Yucatan, and had become acquainted with the
    language. Thinking that this ecclesiastic would be useful for the work
    of converting the Indians to the faith, he made him his vicar and sent
    him into the interior to preach amongst the natives. After a lapse
    of several months he received a letter from the vicar stating that
    he had been told by one of the principal caciques, that it was known
    that, anciently, there had arrived in Yucatan twenty strangers. They
    were dressed in long robes, had sandals upon their feet, and taught
    religion. It was also mentioned that these men wore long beards,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
    and that they had a leader who was named Cucul-can (Quetzalcoatl).</p>

  <p>Las Casas concludes by observing that “Certainly the land and kingdom
    of Yucatan gives us to understand most especial things, and of the
    greatest antiquity with regard to the grand, admirable and exquisite
    styles of ancient edifices, and writings of certain characters which
    are in no other place. Finally, these are secrets which God only knows.
    (<span xml:lang="es">Finalmente, secretos son estos que sólo Dios los sabe</span>).”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

  <p>But the most explicit statements with regard to Quetzalcoatl were
    those which were given by the chief-priests of the temples raised to
    his memory at Cholula.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> They affirmed the tradition of the arrival of
    strangers of a white race and foreign origin coming by sea in vessels
    from the east. These strangers were said to have taught the Indians to
    build monasteries, and maintain seminaries for religious
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>instruction.
    According to Clavigero, they taught certain natives the methods of
    arranging the divisions of time and the use of the calendar. The
    priests also showed the Spaniards some ornaments which they said had
    been worn by the chief of these strangers.</p>

  <p>The positive declarations about white people having landed upon the
    shores of the Mexican Gulf have been carefully investigated. It has
    been usually <span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
    considered that they were the result of a myth, or that
    they were based upon vague traditions relating to events which, if
    they had any foundation, must have happened at a period exceedingly
    remote and possibly referred to early migrations from Asia. But it has
    to be remembered that the facts reported by the caciques and priests
    invariably related to a period when their tribes were established in
    Yucatan or Mexico; and the arrival of the strangers was always said to
    have taken place on the eastern seaboard of those lands. As the Toltecs
    according to the Indian records were not established there before the
    sixth century the event, if it occurred, must have happened after that
    date.</p>

  <p>There are also other circumstances connected with this legend which
    appear, to some extent, to remove it from a mythical character and to
    place it within the limits of legitimate inquiry and investigation. The
    Indians who described the events spoke of them in a manner which was
    not vague, but was clear and decided, and as being within the personal
    knowledge of their ancestors. They also always gave a description of
    the monuments of the strangers or of their chief. Thus, in Yucatan,
    the leader was said to have left that region for the coast of Mexico.
    At Cholula, it was the tradition that Quetzalcoatl, with several of
    his companions, went away to the sea shore near Goascoalco, in the
    direction of Yucatan and never returned. In the regions of the interior
    of Chiapas and Guatemala, it was stated that in several of the native
    manuscripts accounts were given of a great leader or chief named
    Votan who was believed to have arrived in that country with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span> nineteen
    companions or other chiefs. Votan was supposed to have landed in
    America near the Laguna de Terminos and to have established his first
    settlement near Palenque.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

  <p>The most singular circumstance relating to the worship of Quetzalcoatl
    is the fact that a cross should have been the chief emblem in the
    temple especially dedicated to him at Palenque. The fact of this symbol
    being worshipped by the Indians in the New World may perhaps not be
    deemed particularly strange, but it has to be taken into consideration
    that there is no record of any figure in the shape of a cross having
    been an object of devotion in any part of America, except in the
    regions that had been occupied by the Toltecs.</p>

  <p>When the Spaniards arrived in Yucatan they reported that they saw in
    the court of a temple at Cozumel a cross made of lime and stone which
    was worshipped by the natives. There were some doubts about the precise
    meaning assigned to this image, possibly owing to the difficulties of
    understanding the Maya language, but it was afterwards ascertained that
    it represented the god of rain.</p>

  <p>The cross on the altar at Palenque is of an entirely different
    character, and evidently forms the principal part of the emblem
    representing Quetzalcoatl. How did it come to pass that this
    exceptional figure of a cross should have been sculptured upon the
    tablet representing the emblems of the white
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>stranger who, according
    to the Indian traditions, landed upon their shores, coming from the
    east in a sacerdotal dress, wearing sandals upon his feet and having
    red crosses embroidered upon his cape?<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

  <p>It is this coincidence that causes attention to be directed to an
    endeavour to form some reasonable solution of the problem. It will be
    observed, upon an examination of the illustration of the tablet of the
    cross, that the name Quetzalcoatl is represented by the quetzal, the
    emblematic bird of the Quichés, and by peculiar marks surrounding the
    cross which are thought to be intended to denote a serpent (coatl)
    which, as at Uxmal, was probably the Totem of the tribe.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> But
    the principal figure placed in the centre of the altar is the cross.
    This by its shape and position must have been intended to have had an
    especial significance.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span></p>

  <p>It is related by Gomara that, upon the occasion of the discovery of
    Yucatan by the expedition under the command of Francisco Hernandez
    in 1517, the Spaniards observed in the country near Cape Catoche,
    crosses of brass and wood placed over graves. The unexpected finding of
    these crosses in an hitherto unknown land attracted the attention of
    geographers in Spain and, to some extent, led to theories with regard
    to the possible arrival in Yucatan of the Spanish ecclesiastics who
    had, according to an ancient legend, fled from Spain when that country
    was conquered by the Saracens in the eighth century, and were believed
    to have reached an island in the western parts of the Atlantic ocean
    called Antilia.</p>

  <p>What Gomara wrote upon this subject is as follows:—</p>

  <p>“In that place there were found crosses of brass and wood over the
    dead, from whence some argue that many Spaniards had fled to this land
    when the destruction of Spain was done by the Moors in the time of
    the King Don Roderick: but I do not believe it; since there are not
    any in the islands that we have mentioned: in some one of which it is
    necessary, and also compulsory to touch at, before arriving there.”</p>

  <p>Gomara was undoubtedly correct in not believing that these crosses
    were placed over the graves of Spaniards who had arrived in Yucatan
    after the defeat and flight of King Roderick. It is not requisite to
    go back to events that occurred in Spain in the eighth century to
    account for the existence of crosses on the promontory of Cape Catoche.
    When Hernandez landed there in 1517, nearly a quarter of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span> a century
    had elapsed since Columbus had founded his settlements in Cuba and
    Hispaniola, and during that interval many small expeditions had been
    organised by Spanish adventurers for the purpose of exploring the
    coasts in the direction of Honduras and Nicaragua. In pursuing these
    voyages of discovery their vessels must have frequently passed at no
    great distance from the eastern shores of Yucatan where, on their
    return from the south, they would have been baffled by contrary winds
    and currents. Under such conditions it is not improbable that one of
    the vessels may have been wrecked or abandoned off Cape Catoche, and
    that some of the crew perished and were buried by the survivors near
    the seacoast.</p>

  <p>The Spanish legend to which Gomara refers is, with respect to America,
    chiefly remarkable for its surprising concurrence in date and other
    circumstances with the Toltec legend of the arrival of strangers
    wearing cassocks. It is therefore necessary to ascertain if there
    are sufficient reasons for placing any confidence in statements that
    appear to be founded upon tradition, and whether the event that was
    believed to have taken place could have been possible. The tradition
    did not escape the attention of Washington Irving. In his “Life of
    Columbus”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> he states that “It was recorded in an ancient legend,
    that at the time of the conquest of Spain and Portugal by the Moors,
    when the inhabitants fled in every direction to escape from slavery,
    seven bishops, followed by a great number of their people,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>took
    shipping, and abandoned themselves to their fate on the high seas.
    After tossing about for some time, they landed upon an unknown island
    in the midst of the ocean. Here the bishops burnt the ships to prevent
    the desertion of their followers, and founded seven cities.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

  <p>In the principal maps published during the fifteenth century, before
    the discovery of America, the island of Antilia was usually given a
    position in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
    middle of the western Atlantic, south of the Azores.
    In the chart of the geographer Toscanelli, which was sent to Columbus,
    Antilia was placed in the direct track by sea from the Canary islands
    to Cipango (Japan), the large and prosperous country supposed at that
    time to be situated in the extreme west, near the eastern limits of
    Asia. It is evident that Columbus firmly believed in the existence of
    Antilia, for when he left the Canaries on his outward voyage, he shaped
    his course for that island and steered due west for about sixteen
    hundred miles.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching the latitude and longitude where he expected to see
    land, the admiral conferred with his captains, but as nothing had been
    observed it was thought that the ships must have passed the island.
    At sunset, the captain of the Pinta hailed the admiral and reported
    that land was in sight to the south-west. The course of the ships was
    accordingly altered towards that direction. On the next day it was
    found that what had been seen was cloudland. The ships resumed their
    course and proceeded until the landfall was made upon the island of
    Guanahani.</p>

  <p>The belief in the existence of the legendary island was, however,
    not then dispelled and it is remarkable, as a proof of the opinions
    of geographers, that in the important map of the world by Ruysch,
    published in 1508, in which were placed the latest discoveries in the
    west; Antilia still retained its position.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_418f"><img src="images/i_418f.jpg" width="700" height="417" alt="" /></a>

      <span class="small">(Nordenskiöld’s Facsimile Atlas.)</span></div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span></p>

  <p>In the early part of the sixteenth century, several expeditionary
    fleets were fitted out and sailed across the seas towards the New
    World. Many islands were seen, but Antilia was not found. Thus when it
    became known that Yucatan had been discovered and that a cross placed
    within a stone temple was worshipped by the Indians, and that other
    crosses had been seen placed over graves, it was surmised that the
    bishops must have finally reached that distant land.</p>

  <p>Such an event may be thought to be improbable, but as, in consequence
    of the trade-winds, it is not impossible, it is expedient to consider
    in what manner it might have happened. It has to be assumed that the
    legend, so far as it relates to Christian fugitives escaping from the
    tyranny of Mahometan conquerors, may be considered as being within the
    limits of reasonable historical inquiry. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
    Men deliberately leaving
    their own country to seek a place of refuge where they would be free to
    establish their religion, would, before embarking upon unknown seas,
    take with them supplies of provisions and water, and thus, by proper
    precautions, secure themselves from the risk of starvation. It is also
    probable that they were informed by the pilots or other navigators
    acquainted with the adjacent shores, that there were islands situated
    beyond the Mauritanian coasts within a distance not too great for them
    to undertake the voyage with a fair prospect of reaching land.</p>

  <p>In the eighth century the Canary Islands had not been discovered by
    Europeans, but their position was known to the Arabs and Moors and
    rumours concerning them and their proximity to the coast of Morocco
    were doubtless familiar to the sea-faring men living near Cadiz. The
    pilots would, therefore, have shaped a course for the Canaries. They
    would have expected to reach those islands within eight or ten days.
    But a slight error in their course would have taken the vessels into
    the trade-winds and, in that case, they would have been driven across
    the Atlantic in the direction of Florida, whose coasts might easily
    have been reached in less than six weeks from the date of the departure
    from Spain. It is also possible that they may have been chased by some
    of the armed vessels which had conveyed the Saracens from Mauritania.</p>

  <p>It is not, however, necessary to pursue this investigation to any
    greater length. It is sufficiently clear that if the event, as recorded
    by tradition, actually happened, there is no difficulty in accepting
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
    the conclusion that several of the bishops and their companions may
    have reached America in safety.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Thus the statements of the Indian
    priests, that white strangers wearing beards and dressed in cassocks
    had arrived from the East, would be confirmed.</p>

  <p>Upon an examination of the laws that govern the direction of the
    trade-winds in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, it is found that there
    is a strong easterly wind continuously blowing across the Atlantic
    towards Florida, Mexico and Yucatan. There is also a strong westerly
    wind invariably blowing across the North Pacific, over the regions
    between the fortieth and fiftieth parallels of latitude, from Japan
    towards the north-west coast of North America. In consequence of this
    prevailing wind several junks have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
    been driven out of their course
    and have reached the American seacoasts. In 1833 a junk was wrecked
    near Vancouver island and several of the crew landed and were received
    by the Indians. In the previous year a Japanese junk laden with fish
    arrived at the Sandwich islands. She had been driven across the seas by
    a violent storm which had caught her off Japan. Four of her men were
    alive and they were taken to Honolulu.</p>

  <p>Taking therefore into consideration the prevalence of trade-winds
    blowing towards America, and the peculiar conditions of architectural
    and astronomical intelligence possessed by the Mexican Indians, there
    are certain inferences which may be accepted. It is not improbable that
    men belonging to European, Moorish, or Asiatic races arrived in Central
    America during a period between the sixth and eleventh centuries.
    There is not sufficient evidence to determine in what manner this may
    have happened; but after giving due weight to the statements of the
    Indian priests and caciques, and the traditions of the circumstances
    under which their knowledge was introduced into Mexico, together with
    the adoption of monastic institutions, and the systems of education,

      <p>Many of those who were interested in Arctic research and the
        then unknown fate of Sir John Franklin, will remember the meetings
        at Lady Franklin’s house at Kensington Gore, and how greatly Mr.
        Grinnell’s exertions and enterprise were appreciated.</p>

      <p>Mr. Laurence Oliphant, whom I had known in other parts of the
        world, was then living with his community upon the Southern shores
        of Lake Erie.</p>
      <p>The last time that I saw him was at a Levée, held in St. James’s
        extreme Palace, in the year 1880, under circumstances which were
        in contrast with his daily life of labour at Brocton. I understood
        that he had come over to England to arrange some business matters
        connected with the affairs of his society.</p>
      <p>America is the home of many groups of people endeavouring to carry
        out their various schemes of communistic life. I visited several
        of their settlements and found that their methods of management
        were very different. The prosperity and the harmony of the men and
        women, evidently depended upon their faith in their own strange
        forms of religion. It was also observable that, in all cases, the
        leaders were men of dogmatic character.</p>

      <p>The question respecting the proportion of foreigners in the
        armies of the North came under consideration.</p>
      <p>It had been supposed that a large number of the troops consisted
        of men of foreign nationalities, but an investigation that had
        been made into the subject has proved that the alien strength of
        the army had been the subject of much exaggeration.</p>
      <p>Upon the examination of the numbers it will be seen, however,
        that the composition of the forces deserves attention. Their
        classification was as follows:—</p>

      <p>In one of the many brilliant speeches made by this orator, the
        following graceful allusion to the mother-country may be mentioned
        here. “Great Britain,” he said, “had dotted over the whole surface
        of the globe with her possessions and military posts, whose
        morning drum-beat, following the sun and keeping company with the
        hours, circles the earth daily with one continuous and unbroken

        placed at their disposal to enable them to become a great maritime
        nation.</p>
      <p>There is, however, a difficulty for them to surmount. Serviceable
        American-born men do not readily volunteer to join their ships
        of war, and, consequently, the crews are largely composed of
        foreigners, chiefly of English and German origin. The reasons
        for this disinclination on the part of the Americans to accept
        sea service seem to be caused by the fact that the prospects
        for success in life in other directions are sufficiently good
        to prevent them from seeking an employment in which they would
        be subject to discipline and have to sacrifice their habits of
        independence. It will probably be found expedient, ultimately, to
        adopt a system of entry and training for seamen similar to that
        which has been found to succeed in England. The systems followed
        on the European continent, and which are based upon conscription,
        could find no place amongst a people with whom all service must be
        essentially voluntary.</p>
      <p>If the difficulties with regard to men can be overcome, the naval
        strength of the United States may be as great as Congress may
        deem desirable, for, with respect to the capacities of harbours
        and dockyards and the means available for the construction and
        armaments of ships, there is practically no limit to the power of
        fitting out and maintaining large fleets.</p>

      <p>In the summer of 1870 I went to the village of Dighton to look
        at the inscribed stone in the river near that place.</p>
      <p>Upon my arrival there it was high water and the rock was covered.
        The next day, when the tide was low, I hired a boat, pulled down
        the stream and stopped by its side, which was then fully exposed,
        and examined it with care. It was a boulder formed of hard close
        grained granite.</p>
      <p>As the inscription was originally supposed by Danish and other
        antiquarians to have had some relation with the history of the
        arrival of the Northmen upon that coast, I traced the figures and
        rude characters with particular attention.</p>
      <p>I have seen rolls of birch bark scratched in the same manner by
        Chippewas, for the purpose of giving information of the movements
        of their hunting parties, and I think that the figures on the
        Dighton stone were meant to represent similar events. As, however,
        the inscriptions are deeply cut, and as it must have taken some
        considerable time to execute them, it may be granted that the
        Indians wished to leave, near the mouth of the river, a permanent
        record which would be intelligible to others.</p>
      <p>At many parts of this seaboard the New England tribes, as at
        Damariscotta visited the tidal waters to obtain food.</p>

      <p>When afterwards passing through the forests near Palenque,
        in Central America, I observed that whenever the Indians found
        it necessary to quit the track, they immediately broke off small
        branches from the trees, and placed them on the ground over which
        they had trodden. As an additional precaution, they also made
        marks on the trunks with their hatchets. It was thus easy for
        them to get back to the place from which they had started. It is
        however evident, that this plan is only useful in those cases
        where the path is intentionally left. When the path is
        accidentally missed, it is of the greatest importance not to lose
        touch with the spot where you happen to be when your error is
        discovered. This position will necessarily be within a short
        distance by a straight line from the place from which you
        wandered. It has been ascertained that it is the tendency of men
        who have lost their way to unconsciously move in a circle, and
        thus much time may be wasted in trusting to personal judgment. It
        is a good plan to make a series of short tentative marches in
        different directions, in straight lines from your starting point,
        which should be considered as a central position to which you can
        always return if necessary. Such straight lines of direction can
        be made by marking trees, and keeping them as much as possible in
        line with each other. In dense forests a watch is not serviceable,
        as the sun does not penetrate them, and its bearing cannot be
        seen. A compass is useful to a certain extent, but the constant
        deviations that have to be made to avoid obstacles, tend to make
        the line of progress a succession of broken curves, and it becomes
        unsafe to rely upon the accuracy of the direction. Explorers have
        found it desirable to send men occasionally to the tops of the
        tallest trees to observe the nature of the country that is being
        traversed. When Cortes made his celebrated expedition from Mexico
        to Honduras, he maintained a straight march by the use of a ship’s
        compass, but in that case there was no difficulty, for the
        direction was followed by cutting down the trees that were in the
        line of the advance.</p>

      <p>The Jesuit Mission that was placed at Sault Ste. Marie, at
        the entrance of Lake Superior was, during the seventeenth and
        eighteenth centuries, one of the most important and influential
        of the missionary establishments in North America. Many of the
        Fathers who were attached to it had received a good mathematical
        education and were capable of making accurate geographical
        surveys. An excellent plan of Lake Superior and its islands was
        made by them in 1670, and the coast lines and bays were traced
        over a distance exceeding fifteen hundred miles. Amongst the
        distinguished men who worked at the mission were the Fathers
        Jogues, Allouez, Mesnard (who lost his way and perished in the
        forest when travelling across the Kee-wai-wona promontory),
        Dablon, and the well-known and devoted missionary, Jacques
        Marquette.</p>

      <p>It is known that a communication between the south-western
        extremity of Lake Superior and the Mississippi Valley, existed
        from an early time. When I was at Toronto, Professor Daniel
        Wilson, to whom I was indebted for much information upon subjects
        relating to American archæology, told me that it had been
        ascertained that the copper found in these mounds, was of the same
        character as that in the Lake Superior Mines: so that the question
        of its origin was practically settled. It thus seems probable that
        some of the small lumps of pure copper found in the forests and on
        the shores of the lake, near the Kee-wai-wona promontory, were
        brought into Ohio.</p>
      <p>A mound that was opened near Lake Ontario, and whose contents I
        examined, was stated to have been twelve feet high. Within it were
        about twenty skeletons, some coarse pottery, a number of arrow
        heads made of a hard flinty stone and several flat rectangular
        stones, pierced with one or two holes, which had been used as
        breast ornaments, possibly denoting a certain rank. There were
        also stone gouges, some stone axes and many fragments of charred
        wood. This was probably an Iroquois grave.</p>

      <p>In the valley of the Mississippi, especially in the northern
        part which had been occupied by the Dakotas, I afterwards saw many
        burial mounds, which, with the exception of the unusually great
        mounds near Miamisburgh and Wheeling, resembled in all respects
        those in Ohio. The methods of burial with the Sioux were evidently
        similar to those of the Mound Builders, with respect to the custom
        of conveying skeletons from considerable distances for the purpose
        of placing them together in one burying heap.</p>
      <p>In several of the ancient burial mounds in Ohio, thin flat plates
        or slabs of mica are placed with the skeletons. This shining and
        silvery looking mineral appears to have been greatly valued by
        Indians. When I was on the coast of California, I happened to
        be present when a shell bank was cut open and a section of it
        examined. There was found, piled within it, a confused heap of
        skulls and shells, together with a larger quantity of rough pieces
        of mica. It is remarkable that the use of mica as an ornament
        should have been prevalent over such a wide geographical area
        amongst tribes dwelling so far apart.</p>

      <p>I have seen a re-survey of the Newark inclosures made on
        behalf of the Smithsonian Institution, under the direction of
        Professor Cyrus Thomas. The results of this survey are very
        useful. The measurements have evidently been taken with much care.
        With respect to the Octagon, Professor Thomas observes that, “The
        angles at the crossings of the diagonals and diameters at the
        centre O, are so nearly right angles as to be worthy of notice in
        this connection. For instance, the angles at the crossings of the
        diagonals BF and DH, differ but 10´ from true right angles, while
        those at the crossing of the diameters AE and CG differ but 2´.”</p>
      <p>As regards the Square he states, that, “This inclosure varies but
        slightly from a true square, the course of the opposite sides in
        one case differing but 31´, and the other but 6´. The greatest
        variation at the corners from a true right angle is 57´.”</p>
      <p>The large Circle D is said to have a difference of diameters of
        twenty-six feet, these being respectively 1189 feet and 1163 feet.</p>
      <p>The Observatory Circle, which is the inclosure connected with the
        Octagon, was found to have been made with remarkable correctness.
        “The widest divergence between the line of the survey and the
        circumference of the true circle is four feet. It is therefore
        evident that the inclosure approaches in form very nearly an
        absolute circle.”</p>
      <p>Professor Thomas also states with reference to the Observatory
        Circle, that the radius is almost an exact multiple of the
        surveyor’s chain.</p>
      <p>The geometrical accuracy of the lines of embankments and of the
        inclosed areas in earthworks of such great dimensions, covering
        such large spaces of ground, is not the least strange fact
        concerning these works.</p>

        an alliance with the French, and obtained their assistance in
        protecting them from the attacks of hostile tribes. These were
        probably the Iroquois, who at that period had made a treaty with
        the English, and were their allies during the wars against the
        French in Canada and this part of North America.</p>

      <p>Florida was discovered in 1512 by Ponce de Leon, the aged
        governor of Porto Rico, who was then seeking for the Fountain of
        Youth, which, according to the statements of the historian of the
        voyage, was believed to have the power to rejuvenate old men, and
        restore to them the vigour of early manhood.</p>
      <p>An expedition undertaken a few years later, in 1528, by Pamphilo
        de Narvaez had a disastrous termination. Many Spaniards were left
        behind, the majority of whom were probably tortured and killed.
        Others, in accordance with Indian customs, may have been chosen by
        squaws to be their husbands, and would have consequently taken
        part in the conduct of tribal affairs.</p>
      <p>It is not unlikely that some of these Spanish adventurers, would
        have taken advantage of any opportunity that may have occurred, to
        proceed into the interior of the new continent. Due consideration
        should also be given to the fact that the French may have assisted
        the Indians in the construction of their forts on the plains, at
        any period between the dates of their first partial occupation of
        Canada in 1541, and the final abandonment of their positions in
        the valley of the Ohio in 1758.</p>
      <p>Amongst the various opinions that have been held with respect to
        the Mound Builders, there is one which attributes their origin to
        the northern part of Mexico.</p>
      <p>Mr. Lewis Morgan, whose works upon the subject of the Indian races
        have placed him in the position of being a high authority upon all
        matters relating to them, wrote to me a letter upon the question
        of their migrations, in which he observed as follows:—“Any opinion
        as to who were the mound builders must be speculative. It is quite
        probable that they were village Indians from New Mexico, and
        having found the climate too severe for their type of village
        life, retired gradually from the country.” Although it has to be
        admitted that all theories as to the Mound Builders must be
        necessarily indeterminate, yet nothing has been found amongst the
        ornaments or weapons that were placed in their burial mounds,
        which supports the hypothesis that they were different in race or
        intelligence from the tribes that surrounded them.</p>

        temple.</p>
      <p>Judge Williams had personally known Joseph Smith, the founder of
        Mormonism, and Rigdon his chief colleague. Joseph Smith, he said,
        was an illiterate man, but, was remarkable for a kind of
        shrewdness combined with great insight into character.</p>
      <p>Rigdon, who had been formerly a Baptist preacher, was well

        explaining to them the meaning of Smith’s visions and the

        scene viewed from the deck of H.M.S. Racer when passing at sunset
        the promontory of Cape Leucate, in Santa Maura, the classical site
        of Sappho’s leap. There is a special interest attached to the
        fate of Winona, for it proves that Indian girls of Dakota birth
        are capable of higher degrees of sentiment with regard to their
        marriage, than those believed to exist among other tribes. She
        was not permitted for some tribal reason to marry the man she had
        chosen, and preferred death to marriage with the warrior to whom
        she was assigned by the command of her parents.</p>

      <p>“I was greatly surprised,” states Captain Carver, “at
        beholding an instance of such elevated devotion in so young an
        Indian, and instead of ridiculing the ceremonies attending it, as
        I observed my Catholic servant tacitly did, I looked on the prince
        with a greater degree of respect for these sincere proofs he gave
        of his piety; and I doubt not, but that his offerings and prayers,
        were as acceptable to the universal Parent of mankind, as if they
        had been made with greater pomp, or in a consecrated place.”

      <p>One of the best authenticated instances of this custom of
        torturing prisoners was witnessed by a Mr. James Smith who, during
        the time that he was a captive amongst the Delawares, was present
        when the English prisoners taken after General Braddock’s defeat
        were brought into camp by the Indians.</p>
      <p>He states that, upon that occasion, about a dozen of the prisoners
        were stripped and tied to stakes, tortured with fire-brands and
        burnt to death.</p>
      <p>The ferocity of the Indians towards their captives after battle
        was well known to the British and French commanders, and was one
        of the difficulties that attended their employment as allies.
        There is a subject indirectly connected with these Indian customs
        in war which may here be considered. It is that of cannibalism.</p>
      <p>Investigations into this question lead to the conclusion that
        there is no evidence to show that any of the North American tribes
        were in the habit of following this revolting custom except under
        rare circumstances during the prosecution of a serious war.</p>
      <p>I only know of two instances, seen and recorded, of Indians
        devouring human flesh. In both cases it is evident that the acts
        were committed in accordance with the usages of hostile tribes
        when engaged in war.</p>
      <p>The first case is mentioned in a report made to his superiors, by
        the French missionary, Father Roubaud, who accompanied the Indian
        allies of the French troops during the operations against the
        British forces in 1757.</p>
      <p>An English captive, who was believed to have been an officer, was
        cooked and eaten by the Ottawas under circumstances singularly
        repulsive. The Father Roubaud, who was present and witnessed part
        of the proceedings, was horrified by what he saw, and finding that
        he could do nothing to check the tribe in their savage feast was
        forced to withdraw to his tent.</p>
      <p>The other instance occurred after the capture of the garrison of
        Michel Mackinac by the Chippewas. Mr. Alexander Henry, the same
        person who, at another time, undertook the mining operations on
        the shores of Lake Superior which are mentioned in a preceding
        chapter, was a captive. He states that one of the white prisoners
        was killed and divided into five parts which were cooked in five
        kettles and then eaten at a special feast.</p>
      <p>Mr. Henry was of opinion, from what he observed, that this food
        was taken with repugnance. An Indian told him that what he saw was
        done to inspire the warriors with courage.</p>

      <p>When I was at the village of San Domingo del Palenque in
        Central America, Dr. Coller, a resident there, told me he had
        carried out, during several years, a series of investigations to
        ascertain the reasons for the existence of large green savannahs
        in the heart of the adjacent forests. He had formed the conclusion
        that those open spaces were caused by the exceptional character of
        the ground which, he said, differed from that upon which the trees
        grew. The similar openings amongst the forests in Ceylon called
        patenas, are, I believe, also supposed to be the effect of the
        nature or poverty of the land.</p>
      <p>It is noticeable that the forests usually skirt or surround
        savannahs in sharp well-defined outlines like an enclosing
        barrier, in the same manner as the meadows, formed by the
        consequences of the action of beavers, occur in Michigan.</p>

      <p>After my return to England I happened to discuss this subject
        with Colonel Yule, who had just then completed his work of editing
        the Travels of Marco Polo. He told me that when he was in Burmah,
        Lord Dalhousie, who was at that time Governor-General of India,
        sent him into the interior to visit the forests of Aracan.</p>
      <p>He found within them several large clearings, and observed that
        the new growths were of a different character from the old trees
        and were invariably bamboos. He also saw amongst the mountains
        many deciduous trees which were quite bare of leaves whilst their
        branches were covered with brilliantly coloured flowers.</p>
      <p>Upon another occasion Dr. Rae, who had passed much of his life in
        the Hudson Bay Territories and became known by his discovery of
        the relics of Sir John Franklin’s expedition, mentioned to me that
        he had frequently seen that when trees had been uprooted,
        raspberry bushes sprang up in their place thus showing that their
        seeds must have been in the ground. Dr. Joseph Norwood, Assistant
        Geologist, in his report of the survey of the region west of Lake
        Superior, undertaken in 1847, states that from facts which had
        come under his observation, he was led to believe that, “if after
        the clearing of the pine forests, the annual fires cease, a growth
        of oak springs up in some places and aspen in others.” (<cite>Owen’s
        Geological Survey</cite>, pp. 296). In British Columbia the ancient
        forest pines are often succeeded by cedars or alders.</p>

      <p>The subject of the destruction of snakes is mentioned by Mr.
        Murray, in his “Travels in North America.”</p>
      <p>When passing through a ravine in the territories of the Pawnees
        he observed, “I never should have believed it possible that so
        many rattlesnakes could have been assembled together as I saw in
        that ravine. I think there must have been nearly enough to fatten
        a drove of Missouri hogs,” and he adds in a note. “It is well
        known that in the Western States where rattlesnakes are still
        plentiful the hogs kill and eat them; nor is their bite formidable
        to their swinish enemy, on whom its venomous fangs seem to produce
        no effect. It is owing to this well-known fact that families
        resident in those districts conceive that hogs-lard must be a kind
        of antidote to their poison, and frequently use it (I believe
        successfully) as a remedy.” (<i>Travels in North America, by Hon.
        Charles Augustus Murray, Vol.</i> ii, <i>pp</i>. 42.)</p>
      <p>An Englishman who had a large farm in West Virginia, told me that
        the hillsides were cleared of the snakes, which had previously
        infested them, by turning out pigs upon them.</p>
      <p>A similar result took place in Minnesota and upon the prairies
        east of the Missouri.</p>

      <p>The Council building on the reservation was called the Long
        House, not on account of its size or shape, but in accordance with
        an ancient tradition.</p>
      <p>When the separation of the Iroquois took place, it was decided by
        the Council that the expression Long House was to be used as a
        symbol, that the nations were theoretically under one roof, which
        extended over all the lands occupied by them. In pursuance of this
        theory, certain tribes were given particular duties. The Senecas
        had to guard the gates looking towards the sunset, and the Mohawks
        were to watch the approaches to the gates placed in the direction
        of sunrise.</p>
      <p>As far as it is possible to form conclusions, with respect to the
        state of the Indian tribes in the sixteenth century, it appears
        that the Iroquois, in consequence of their league, had attained
        to a comparatively advanced state of warlike capacity, and had
        organised methods of conducting a campaign.</p>
      <p>They also formed regular alliances, and made treaties which they
        faithfully executed.</p>
      <p>In their treatment of captives they were cruel and barbarous, but
        they possessed in the highest degree the qualities of courage and
        endurance.</p>

      <p>I should here mention that, when I was at Boston, I was much
        assisted in making investigations into certain characteristics of
        the North American Indians by Mr. Francis Parkman, whose
        researches upon all subjects relating to the condition of the
        aboriginal tribes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, have
        placed him in the first rank of the historians of that period.</p>
      <p>Mr. Parkman was personally well acquainted with the Dakotas,
        amongst whom he had dwelt for nearly two years.</p>
      <p>He, on several occasions arranged, in the kindest manner, that I
        should meet those who were interested in the native races. Upon
        one of these occasions I met Mr. E. G. Squier, whose original
        surveys of the ancient earthworks in Ohio were published by the
        Smithsonian Institution.</p>
      <p>The introductions given to me by Mr. Parkman to the distinguished
        archæologists, Mr. Lewis Morgan and Professor Daniel Wilson, were
        also most useful.</p>

      <p>In the prison at Omaha I saw three Pawnees named Blue-Hawk,
        Yellow-Son and Tall-Wolf, who had endeavoured to commit suicide in
        order to avoid being hanged. One of them, I think it was Blue-Hawk
        (Sha-to-ko), had managed to conceal a long piece of hard wood,
        one end of which he had rubbed down to a sharp point. He was
        employed in pushing this through his body, between the ribs, when
        he was observed by the warder and prevented from completing his
        purpose. Another prisoner had removed a brick from the floor and
        was trying to fracture his skull with it. All of them had torn
        away portions of their skin and cut themselves in many places with
        small fragments of glass which they had obtained secretly. The
        warder told me that he had taken every precaution to stop these
        desperate attempts of the Indians to destroy themselves. They
        seemed to be able to bear these self inflicted wounds without
        showing signs of distress.</p>

      <p>The supernatural powers attributed to the “medicine men” are
        not worthy of attention, except so far as they illustrate the
        credulity of Indians, and show the influence of certain methods of
        imposture upon them. Their tricks are usually of a kind which are
        perfectly within the capacity of an ordinary juggler.</p>
      <p>Their pretension of possessing the power of making rain is however
        a subject of a different nature.</p>
      <p>This particular act is chiefly remarkable because there is no form
        of imposture which can be so readily detected. Nevertheless the
        Indian tribes throughout the western parts of North America
        usually have “Rain-makers,” in whose powers they appear to have
        confidence.</p>
      <p>I met in California a young Englishman who had been living for
        several months with various tribes near the coast, between British
        Columbia and New Mexico.</p>
      <p>He told me that he had been present upon an occasion when a
        successful attempt at rain-making occurred. The event took place
        upon a promontory in the southern part of California.</p>
      <p>The tribe wanted rain, and their rain-maker declared that he could
        obtain what was desired. He proceeded to make upon an adjoining
        hill, a large bonfire which was kept well supplied with fuel and
        gave out dense volumes of smoke. The fire was kept burning for
        over twenty-four hours, and then the efforts of the rain-maker
        were rewarded by a good and sufficient fall of rain. Here, as
        elsewhere, the Indians employed fire and smoke as agents for
        producing rain.</p>

      <p>With many of the Dakota and Chippewa tribes there existed a

        red, blue and white. They believed that the spirit of the Indian
        had to cross a river over which was a long log of wood. Upon
        reaching the opposite bank, the spirit met the spirits of his
        enemies. To one of them he would show the red, to another the
        blue, and finally he pointed to the white and then all enmities ceased.</p>

      <p>The albatrosses in the Southern ocean which, like the
        pelicans, are birds of great size and weight (I have measured some

        equal height above the level of the sea.</p>
      <p>In the high latitudes south of the Cape of Good Hope and the
        Crozet Islands there is always a strong gale blowing, and
        consequently by a very slight and imperceptible movement or
        inclination of the wings the albatrosses obtained the necessary
        pressure which enabled them to rise, descend, or maintain their
        hovering position.</p>
      <p>In the case of pelicans moving rapidly in a perfect calm, the

      <p>The substances thrown out from craters frequently differ in
        their character. Judging from the composition of the surface of
        portions of the land near the Guatemala volcanoes, especially upon
        the slopes of the barrancas, it is evident that large quantities
        of pozzolana were ejected. One of the latest eruptions that has
        occurred was at the Island of Santorin in the Grecian Archipelago
        in February, 1866. I was present when the new volcano emerged from
        the sea.</p>
      <p>The inhabitants of Santorin, upon seeing volumes of steam and
        smoke issuing from the waters of the bay, apprehended some serious
        peril to be imminent. They feared the possibility of their town
        being overwhelmed by an eruption of ashes, and made a request that
        a ship of war should be sent to the spot to render any assistance
        that might be necessary. I immediately went there in the “Racer”
        and remained until all fears of danger had passed away.</p>
      <p>The crater of the volcano, afterwards called Aphroessa, rose
        slowly from the surface of the water, and it was possible to
        observe the nature of the interior during the intervals between
        the eruptions. There was no lava or pozzolana, but only large
        cinders which, as they issued from the crater, were thrown into
        the air, and then fell upon the outer slopes, thus gradually
        forming an island.</p>
      <p>It was a very remarkable scene; during the day there were heavy
        volumes of smoke and constant rumbling sounds, as the pent up
        forces below the mouth of the crater were gathering strength to
        throw forth the mass of cinders that closed them in. At night the
        glare caused by the reflection of the fire of the interior upon
        the dense clouds immediately overhanging it was very vivid. The
        surface of the surrounding waters was over-spread by running
        tongues of brilliantly coloured flames. The island was composed of
        cinders and ashes, whose porous nature could never permit any
        lodgement of water upon them. I examined several of the craters of
        the extinct volcanoes on the islands adjacent to Aphroessa, and
        there was no instance of any small pond or collection of water
        existing within them. The interior of the Volcan de Agua, possibly
        contained a thick substratum of water-bearing pozzolana.</p>

        Lyell. “Principles of Geology.” Vol. ii, pp. 70.</p>

      <p>Palacio’s Report was published for the first time in the
        original Spanish by Mr. E. G. Squier, in 1860. As it is important
        that the author’s meaning should not be misunderstood, I have
        translated it literally, as far as this is possible, considering
        that it is written in the Spanish of the 16th century.</p>

      <p>Diaz observes that Guatimozin—who, after the death of
        Montezuma had become the Emperor of the Mexicans—sent the hands
        and feet of the Spaniards that had been sacrificed, together with
        the heads of the horses that had been killed, to the Indian chiefs
        who had formed a league of alliance with Cortes, and sent them
        messages to the effect, that the remaining Spaniards would soon be
        conquered, and that consequently those chiefs should submit to the
        Aztec power and send ambassadors to him. In the meantime, human
        sacrifices took place daily in the great temple, accompanied by
        the dismal sound of the drum, the discordant noises of the shell
        trumpets, and the horrible shouts and yells of the Mexicans.
        During the night large fires were kept burning on the platform,
        and on each night several Spaniards were sacrificed.</p>
      <p>These ceremonies lasted for ten days, until all the captives had
        been sacrificed; and during this time the Mexicans made frequent
        and furious attacks upon the troops. Diaz relates, that the Indian
        soldiers told them that they were wretched creatures who would
        soon be all killed, and that their flesh was disagreeable to taste
        and bad to eat. <span xml:lang="es">“Vuestras carnes son tan malas para comer.”</span></p>
      <p>The last Spaniard who was sacrificed was Christobal de Guzman.</p>

        in the manner of their devotion to what is to be seen at the
        “Pardons” of the Bretons, where the peasants come from long
        distances, light their candles, and kneel before the church door,
        the line of the worshippers often extending beyond the precincts
        of the churchyard.</p>

      <p>When I passed through Mexico, the execution of the Emperor
        Maximilian and the unhappy fate of the Empress Carlotta, were
        subjects of discussion. It has often been a matter of surprise,
        that Juarez should have thought it necessary that the sentence of
        the court-martial should be carried out. The French troops, upon
        whom the stability of the empire depended, had been withdrawn,
        and the success of the National party was assured. An act of
        forbearance upon this occasion would have met with approval, and
        have been acknowledged as a wise exercise of superior authority.
        It was however otherwise determined, and the Emperor was shot
        outside the walls of Querétaro.</p>
      <p>In the American official book upon Mexican affairs, there is a
        memorandum of the conversation between Mr. Seward, the Foreign
        Secretary, and Señor Matias Romero, the Mexican Minister, at
        Washington. Mr. Seward stated, that England, France and Austria,
        had desired the United States to use their good offices for
        Maximilian, and further observed, that “Mr. Seward does not fear
        any contingency possible in virtue whereof any European power may
        attempt to invade or interfere in future in Mexico, or in any
        other Republican nation on this continent. For this reason he does
        not think that Mexico need fear any attempt at reprisals on the
        part of any European powers, as a consequence of any extreme
        decision which the Mexican Government may take; but at the same
        time, Mr. Seward also believes that a feeling universally
        favourable, conciliatory and friendly towards the Republic of
        Mexico and the other American Republics, would probably be the
        result of the act of clemency and magnanimity, which the United
        States have thought proper to recommend.”</p>
      <p>Clemency is not a quality that naturally exists in the mind of a
        North or Central American Indian.</p>

      <p>The method of building their huts varies amongst different
        tribes, but the general principles are much the same. I have
        passed many hours of the day and night within them, and noticed
        their practical convenience in tropical climates; and although,
        according to civilised ideas of comfort, there is much that is
        wanting, yet for the purposes of the simple and solitary lives of
        these shy and inoffensive Indians, it would be difficult to
        contrive any shelter more suitable for their requirements.</p>

      <p>Dr. Coller was surprised to see me. It was supposed that I was

        was an Englishman.</p>

        hamlet as I saw it in the month of March, would concur with him in
        saying:</p>

      <p>The areas occupied by the temples differed considerably in
        their extent. The largest of them which I measured was that of the
        Temple of the Cross.</p>
      <p>Its interior dimensions were forty-three feet seven inches long
        by twenty-five feet four inches deep; the outer walls were three
        feet thick. Therefore the ground space covered by the building was
        nearly fifty feet in frontage and a little more than thirty-one
        feet in depth. Its exterior height was about twenty feet. The
        measurements of the temple on the adjoining pyramid were less.</p>

      <p>A clear and instructive memoir by Professor Charles Rau, upon
        the subject of the interpretation of the Palenque hieroglyphs, is
        to be found in one of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,
        published in 1879.</p>
      <p>Investigations have also been made in England, France and Germany.
        I believe it has been ascertained that a dot means one, a bar
        five, a bar with two dots seven, and two bars represent ten. It
        has also been discovered that the hieroglyphs are to be read from
        left to right, and from the top downwards. If this is correct it
        is a discovery of considerable importance. Upon an examination of
        the illustration in the frontispiece of the Palenque altar tablet
        it will be observed, from the position of the leading groups of
        figures on the left slab, that the heads are probably intended to
        represent the chiefs of the Toltec tribe.</p>
      <p>The numerous explorations that have latterly taken place
        throughout Mexico, Guatemala and Yucatan have practically
        determined the positions and extent of all the ancient Indian
        ruins that still exist in those lands. Therefore it is not
        expected that any more discoveries of importance will be made. It
        is however possible that one or more small temples or structures
        may be found hidden among the forests in the line of direction
        between Ocosingo and Flores.</p>
      <p>In the United States much attention is being given to the study of
        the Mexican and Maya manuscripts.</p>
      <p>It is to be hoped that methods of interpretation will be
        established upon a sound basis, and that the characters written
        upon the codices, and the hieroglyphs graven upon the idols and
        stone tablets will be ultimately deciphered.</p>

      <p>Some years after my return to England I had a long
        conversation upon the subject of alligators with Mr. Bates, who
        was then our Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, and
        whose knowledge upon all matters concerning the habits of animals
        in tropical lands was very extensive. In his book “The Naturalist
        on the Amazons,” he mentions a case that happened at a place
        called Carcara.</p>
      <p>An Indian, one of the crew belonging to a trading canoe, whilst in
        a half-drunken state went down to bathe in the lake and stumbled.
        A pair of gaping jaws seized him round the waist and dragged him
        under water; after a short lapse of time the brute came up to
        breathe and was seen with one leg of the man sticking out from his
        jaws.</p>
      <p>Other instances of this kind have been mentioned by naturalists,
        but I do not remember any cases of men being seized when actually
        swimming in the water. Possibly my Indians may have known from
        hearsay or experience the truth of what they stated.</p>
      <p>It has been said that alligators, owing to the formation of their
        throats, cannot swallow their prey in the water, but are obliged
        to go to the banks for that purpose.</p>
      <p>It was not, however, upon the subject of the danger to men from
        approaching these reptiles that the conversation chiefly turned.</p>
      <p>We discussed the question of their food supply. Mr. Bates said
        that they lived upon fish. I observed, with reference to that part
        of the river where I had seen them congregated in such amazing
        numbers, that it was impossible that the supply of food from fish
        alone could be sufficient, and also that in consequence of the
        filthy state of the water no fish could live in it.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bates after some consideration said that their food must be
        fish, but he added, that it was probable that they could live in
        an almost torpid condition for long periods.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bates felt assured that fish formed the food of alligators. It
        was not possible to feel quite satisfied with this solution of the
        problem, especially under circumstances where alligators abound in
        stagnant lagoons in which fish must necessarily be scarce.</p>
      <p>In the unfrequented parts of the estuaries of rivers flowing into
        the Caribbean sea, it can be understood that at certain seasons of
        the year the supply of fish may be great, and we have the
        authority of that careful observer Mr. Bartram, for the statement
        that upon those occasions the numbers of alligators crowding the
        rivers in Florida were astonishing.</p>
      <p>In 1853 the “Vestal” happened to be cruising off Cuba, and I was
        sent in charge of the boats to look for fresh water in Guantanomo
        harbour, at a spot which was reputed to have been a favourite
        haunt of pirates in the seventeenth century.</p>
      <p>After some search we discovered a small stream, but the entrance
        was defended by such crowds of alligators that we had great
        difficulty in passing through them. If, as was possible, they were
        waiting for the arrival of fish from the upper waters, it may be
        inferred that a comparatively small supply of food suffices for
        their sustenance.</p>

      <p>The facing stones placed upon the walls of the ruins of Mitla,
        in the Mexican province of Oaxaca, are fitted, or bedded, into the

      <p>At one of the evening conversaziones given by the Royal Society at
        Burlington House, in the spring of 1892, I happened to discuss the
        subject of Palenque and Uxmal with Mr. Woolner, the sculptor. Some
        experiments had previously been carried out in France which had
        proved that with stone chisels it was possible to carve granite,
        limestones, and hard sandstones.</p>
      <p>The investigations did not, however, make it clear how it could
        have happened that the Indian sculptors were able to work with
        such facility that they covered their buildings with deeply
        chiselled ornamentation. Mr. Woolner said that he thought it
        probable that the Indians may have been acquainted with some
        strong acids, and that they may have used these to soften the
        stone and make it more workable.</p>
      <p>We were looking at some photographs exhibited by Mr. Maudslay,
        who had lately returned from Palenque, and the question of the
        method of carving the outlines of the figures on the stone slabs
        of the courts came under consideration. Mr. Woolner thought that
        the subject was very difficult, but that it was possible that the
        figures had been previously traced and then worked with acid as he
        had already suggested.</p>

        from the forests of Palenque. Memories of the Eton playing fields

        line, <span xml:lang="la">“Pallida mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas regumque

        1853, seventeen years earlier.</p>
      <p>The Vestal, a twenty-six gun frigate in which I was then serving,
        had captured three slavers off the north coast of Cuba. One of
        them was a fast sailing vessel called the Venus. She had become
        notorious for her success in evading our cruisers and landing
        large cargoes of slaves.</p>
      <p>When we arrived off the mouth of the port of Havannah we formed
        our fleet of prizes into line and passed between the castles in
        triumph: our movements being watched by thousands of the Spanish
        inhabitants as we took up our anchorage in the centre of the
        harbour.</p>

      <p>According to Humboldt, the Toltecs arrived in Anáhuac
        (Mexico) A.D. 648, and reached Tula in 670. The pyramids of
        Téotihuacan, a few leagues north of the modern city of Mexico,
        were built by them. They afterwards raised the great pyramid of
        Cholula, and on its platform built a temple for the worship of
        Quetzalcoatl. From Cholula, colonies of the Toltecs went to
        Tabasco and Yucatan.</p>
      <p>The Aztecs arrived in Mexico in 1190, and found there the pyramids
        which they believed to hive been the work of their predecessors
        the Toltecs, who had obtained a knowledge of hieroglyphics and
        of methods of computing time by calendars. The Aztecs founded
        Tenochtitlan (the city of Mexico) in 1325.</p>

      <p>The custom of confining captives or slaves in wooden cages
        for the purpose of being prepared for sacrifice, was supposed to
        have been established by the Aztecs about a century after they had
        settled in Mexico.</p>
      <p>There is reason to believe that in consequence of their being
        surrounded by enemies and engaged in constant wars, they
        considered it necessary to propitiate the war god in the most
        terrific manner. Thus when the great Teocalli, erected for the
        worship of Huitzil-pochli, was completed, many thousands of
        victims were sacrificed as propitiatory offerings. When colonies
        of the Aztec race were advancing in the direction of Tabasco and
        Yucatan, similar sacrificial ceremonies were performed.</p>
      <p>Bernal Diaz saw, in one of the Indian towns that had been captured
        by the Spaniards, three large cages full of prisoners who were
        waiting to be sacrificed. They were fastened by collars to prevent
        their escape. They were taken out of the cages and sent back to
        their own tribes. He elsewhere observes that the Indians devoured
        human flesh after the victims had been sacrificed, in the same way
        as the Spaniards devoured oxen. It is evident that great numbers
        of the aboriginal natives must have been kept in slavery and, in
        time of war, were killed and eaten by the Aztecs.</p>

      <p>It was noticed soon after the Spanish conquest that the
        Indians died rapidly from causes of a mental character. They died
        because they did not wish to live. The conditions of slavery they
        were forced to endure had such an effect upon them that they
        gradually lost their strength. After submitting for a time to
        the hardships imposed upon them they appeared to become resigned
        to their fate. Life was a burden. They lost heart and died from
        misery. This was particularly the case in Cuba and Hispaniola.</p>

      <p>The Indians in Yucatan, had a chief priest who had a general
        control over all matters relating to the priesthood. He nominated
        the priests to the villages, examined them in their sciences and
        ceremonies, provided them with books and sent them to attend in
        the service of the temples.</p>
      <p>According to Landa “they taught the sons of other priests and the
        younger sons of the chiefs that were brought to them for this
        purpose when they were children, if it was observed that they were
        inclined towards this office. The sciences which they taught were
        the computations of the years, months, and days, the festivals and
        ceremonies, the administration of their sacraments, the days and
        times that were fatal, the manner of divinations and prophecies
        and coming events, the remedies for sickness and things concerning
        antiquities, and to read and write with their books, and
        characters with which they wrote and with figures which explained
        the writings.”</p>
      <p>In Yucatan, as in Mexico, the calendar was carefully constructed.
        The year consisted of three hundred and sixty-five days and six
        hours. Landa observes that the months were of two kinds. One was
        lunar and was regulated by the movements of the moon. The other
        method of computation was formed by dividing the year into
        eighteen divisions or months, each consisting of twenty days and
        there were five days and six hours over. Of these six hours one
        day was made every four years. For these three hundred and
        sixty-six days they had twenty letters or characters by which they
        were named. (Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan, pp. 42; 202).</p>
      <p>Las Casas observes in his Apologética Historia, chapter cxxi, that
        “the year of the Mexican people consisted of three hundred and
        sixty-five days divided into eighteen months and five days. Each
        month was twenty days, and the week was thirteen days of which
        they had constituted a calendar, and for each day of the week, of
        the month and of the year they had its idol with its own name, and
        these names were of men, or of women which they held or had held
        as gods; and thus all the days were filled up with these idols
        and names and figures in the same manner as our breviaries and
        calendars have for each day its saint.”</p>
      <p>The illustration of the calendar stone is from a photograph
        taken from the original stone in the city of Mexico. This great
        astronomical record was discovered in the year 1790, buried
        several feet below the surface, in the spot where stood the chief
        pyramid and temple of the Aztecs. It is made from a large mass of
        basalt, and the circular part has a circumference of more than
        thirty-eight feet. It is probably one of the earliest and one of
        the most elaborate of the sculptured works of the Toltecs. It will
        be observed that the points have a singular resemblance to those
        of the mariner’s compass. The head placed in the centre has been
        supposed to represent the Mexican god of the sun. It is possible
        that it may have been intended to represent Quetzalcoatl, the
        traditional teacher and originator of the Mexican knowledge of
        astronomy.</p>

      <p>The fact of men wearing beards would be considered
        extraordinary by the American Indians. Landa states that
        “Cucul-can raised several temples, established regulations for the
        maintenance of good order, and then left Yucatan and proceeded
        towards Mexico.”</p>

      <p>With respect to the ancient Indian structures it is expedient
        to give a brief consideration to those that were raised at
        Copan and Quirigua. The earliest account of the sculptures
        existing at Copan was given by Palacio in 1576. In his Report
        to the King of Spain he mentions that within the ruins was a
        stone cross three palms high, and beyond it “There was a statue
        more than four yards high, sculptured like a bishop in his
        pontifical robes with his mitre well worked and with rings in
        his hands.”</p>
      <p>After describing other large statues and the ruins overlooking
        the river, Palacio observes, “I enquired with all possible
        attention for any traditions from the ancient people as to
        what people lived here, and if anything was known of their
        ancestors, and whether there were any books concerning these
        antiquities ... They say that anciently there came there a
        great chief of the province of Yucatan who made these edifices,
        and after several years he went back to his country, and left
        them solitary and unpeopled.... It also appears that the style
        of the said edifices is like what was found in other places by
        the Spaniards who first discovered Yucatan and Tabasco, where
        figures of bishops were seen and armed men and crosses, and
        since such things have not been found in other regions it can
        be believed that those that made them were probably of one
        nation.” (Report of the Licentiate Dr. Don Diego Garcia de
        Palacio to the King of Spain, 1576.)</p>
      <p>It is recorded by Juarros that in the year 1700, Fuentes, who
        wrote the Chronicles of Guatemala, stated with respect to
        Copan, that the figures, “both male and female were of very
        excellent sculpture, which then retained the colours they had
        been enamelled with; and what was not less remarkable, the
        whole of them were habited in the Castilian costume.” The same
        author relates that at “a short distance, there was a portal
        constructed of stone, on the columns of which were the figures
        of men likewise represented in Spanish habits, with hose, ruff
        round the neck, sword, cap, and short cloak”....</p>
      <p>“All the circumstances,” observes Juarros, “lead to a belief
        that there must have been some intercourse between the
        inhabitants of the old and new world at very remote periods.”</p>
      <p>The information given traditionally by the Indians living at
        Copan, is singularly in accordance with the traditions of the
        priests and caciques in Mexico and Yucatan with respect to the
        arrival of a stranger who commanded temples and pyramids to be
        built and then went away and never returned.</p>
      <p>It is remarkable that, in the first interview between Montezuma
        and Cortes, a singular tradition was mentioned by that Emperor.
        Cortes in his second letter (Segunda carta-relacion) dated
        30th October, 1520, relates that Montezuma spoke to him as
        follows:—“We know from our writings that we received from our
        ancestors, that I and all those who live in this land are not
        the natives of it. We are strangers and came into it from very
        distant regions. We also know that our nation was led here by
        a chief whose vassals all were. He afterwards went back to his
        native country. Afterwards he returned and found that those he
        had left had married the native women (<span xml:lang="es">mujeres naturales</span>) and
        had many children, and had built villages where they lived, and
        when he wished them to proceed with him they did not want to
        go, or even receive him as their chief and therefore he went
        away.”</p>

      <p>Las Casas in commenting upon the subject of the Cozumel
        cross, mentions that it was ten palms high. In the course of
        the extensive explorations carried out by M. Desiré Charnay, in
        1880–82, a similar stone was discovered at Téotihuacan. It is
        considered to be the emblem of Tlaloc, the god of rain.</p>

      <p>Professor Rau in his memoir upon the Palenque tablet, states
        that it is his belief that the Maya language, or a kindred
        dialect, was spoken by the builders of Palenque.</p>
      <p>With regard to this subject it has to be observed that when the
        Toltec tribes, or the tribe that built the temples, settled at
        Palenque they had possibly forgotten their own original language,
        which may have been a Pawnee or Dakota dialect.</p>
      <p>It would naturally happen after their wives had been taken from
        among the aboriginal race, that the children would speak the
        dialects of their mothers. It has been mentioned by an early
        Spanish writer that the Aztecs, when they settled in Mexico,
        endeavoured to establish their own language, but without success.</p>

      <p>According to Gibbon, the Goths under the command of King
        Roderick, were defeated by the Saracens on the plains of Xeres in
        the neighbourhood of Cadiz, upon July 19–26, A.D. 711. This great
        battle decided the fate of Spain. It was supposed that Roderick
        was drowned in the river but it was not known with certainty what
        became of him as his body was never found.</p>

      <p>The subject of the flight of the bishops, was afterwards brought
        into notice by a report of the discovery of the island where they

        century, to be true. An historian states that:—</p>
      <p>“In this yeare also, 1447, it happened that there came a Portugal
        ship through the Streight of Gibraltar; and being taken with a
        great tempest, was forced to runne westward more than willingly
        the men would, and at last they fell vpon an island which had
        seuen cities, and the people spake the Portugall toong, and they
        demanded if the Moores did yet trouble Spaine, whence they had
        fled for the loss which they had received by the death of the King
        of Spain, Don Roderigo.</p>
      <p>The boatswaine of the ship brought home a little of the sand, and
        sold it unto a goldsmith of Lisbon, out of the which he had a good
        quantitie of gold.</p>
      <p>Don Pedro, understanding this, being then gouernor of the realme,
        caused all the things thus brought home, and made knowne, to be
        recorded in the house of Justice.”</p>

      <p>Antilia appears as a large island in the Atlantic in the rare
        maps of Andreas Bianco (1436) and Bartolomeo Pareto (1454). On
        Martin Behaim’s globe (1492) it is placed about eighteen hundred
        miles west of the Canaries. In the earliest maps published after
        the return of Columbus to Spain, Antilia is placed near the newly
        discovered islands of the West Indies.</p>
      <p>The legend upon the accompanying map may be rendered as follows:—</p>
      <p>“The island of Antilia was, at some period, discovered by the
        Lusitanians, but the exact time is not known. There have been
        found there in it families who speak Spanish as it was spoken in
        the days of Roderick, who was the last King of Spain in the time
        of the Goths, and they are supposed to have fled to this island
        from the face of the Barbarians who had then invaded Spain. They
        have here one Archbishop with six other Bishops, each of whom has
        his own proper city, hence it is called by many the island of the
        seven cities. The population are strict Christians and abound in
        all this world’s wealth.”</p>

      <p>In the first voyage of Columbus the vessels left the Canaries
        on the 6th of September and arrived off Guanahani on the night
        of the 11th of October, having been thirty days at sea. They had
        traversed a distance, according to the Admiral’s journal, of 1,092
        leagues or 3,276 miles. On the second voyage from the Canaries to
        Dominica they left on the 3rd of October and arrived on the 3rd of
        November. Upon the last voyage, Columbus left Ferro (one of the
        Canary islands) on the 26th of May and reached St. Lucia in the
        West Indies on the 15th of June. This was a quick passage and only
        occupied twenty days.</p>
      <p>In the Vestal, a sailing frigate of 26 guns, we left the island
        of Gran Canaria in the year 1852, on the morning of the 27th of
        September, and passed between Antigua and Guadeloupe at noon on
        the 16th of October after a voyage of nineteen days, having sailed
        over a distance of 2,800 miles. During the whole of this time we
        were running before the wind with our studding sails set, steering
        West. A favourable N.E. wind prevails from Florida to Yucatan and
        the Mexican coast. With respect to Columbus’s first voyage it
        should be observed that his landfall at Guanahani was four or five
        days’ sail further west than the islands of Dominica and St. Lucia.</p>
